 On today's show, we are taking an inside look at raising up leaders.
 We will have my leaders on the show.
 That is coming up next.
 Welcome to the Crystal Cardo Show, where we discuss leadership and life.
 And discover that business is what you do, not who you are.
 Welcome to the show, folks.
 Fantastic day here on the Crystal Cardo Show.
 Because I think it's because Heather's on.
 It's because that's exactly it.
 It's because I'm on.
 I think so.
 I have multiple people on the show today, which is fantastic.
 We have welcome back to the show, Joel Fordner.
 Thank you.
 Welcome back to the show, Heather LeCurdo.
 No, I think you.
 Are you guys related?
 We may be.
 Okay.
 It's possible.
 We share last name.
 That's crazy, isn't it?
 It just struck me.
 Yeah, it's so funny, yeah, because not only a leader in the business, but also now
 on owner.
 Yeah, my new boss lady, everybody.
 I got a new boss.
 So, hey, folks, here's what we're doing on the show.
 We are talking about, we are taking an inside look into raising up leaders.
 So we have got our two top leaders on the show with us today.
 It's weird.
 I'm looking at you guys a different look over here.
 We've got to look over here.
 We've got our two top leaders on the show that have been with me forever for many, many
 years, and we are going to talk through stories.
 How you guys got to where you are.
 We're going to talk through struggles.
 We're going to talk through growth.
 We're going to talk through all kinds of stuff.
 We've had leaders come in the business and go out of the business and all that kind of
 fun stuff.
 What is it like raising up leaders?
 There's so many of you out there listening today that maybe you're the business owner,
 maybe you're not the owner but you're on the level right underneath the owner.
 And so we're going to be hitting all of that.
 And this we're hoping that this is incredibly helpful for a lot of folks.
 We got a lot of responses back of people saying, hey, we need to hear more leadership information
 on this level.
 So, that is what we are doing today.
 Any input on that?
 It's an exciting discussion we were talking before about how much of a difficulty this can be for
 a lot of owners and leaders is like, how do I do this?
 How do I know what to look for?
 How do I lead leaders?
 How do I teach them stuff?
 How do I get us operating as a leadership team?
 I hear other people have it, but I don't have it.
 Or I've got people doing tasks and I kind of look to them as go to people but they're not
 leaders yet.
 So hopefully you know you guys are going to learn a lot about our own, how we do it here at
 the point main in your group, how Chris and our how Heather and I are led by you success stories
 and difficulties.
 Exactly.
 Yeah, especially Heather's is worse than mine.
 Right, he's a lot easier on me.
 This is family, it's all family, keep it in the family.
 And so we're going to get into a lot of that to unpack the help people see how do we get
 to be a strong leadership team, what are the keys?
 And also what are some of those struggles and stumbles that you need to look out for as well?
 Yeah, and it's so difficult, like you just pointed out, a lot of folks are, how do I just
 lead a person, how do I lead individuals?
 But then what do I do with somebody who becomes between me and other individuals, that leader,
 that layer of leadership where I feel like I just do the same thing and it's totally different.
 It is not the same.
 It is training somebody up to be a great leader and what they do.
 So we're going to talk about anything from you over there, honey.
 I'm just listening and learning.
 You're just here to learn, is that what it is?
 So we're going to talk more about that when we come back right out to this.
 Hey, folks, here's the deal.

 Alright, we are talking today about raising up leaders and we have a whole bunch of information
 to hit.
 We got a lot of stuff that we're going to get to.
 We're going to be talking a lot about how, what does it look like here?
 What a successful leadership look like beyond the business owner, the different layers,
 all that kind of fun stuff, how do you get here?
 What I wanted to do is I wanted to start out with start off the show with y'all's stories,
 your different stories, your journeys, your leadership journeys.
 Who wants to go first on this?
 Joel.
 That was fast.
 That was easy.
 I delegate since I'm learning that.
 I learned that here.
 I was like, did you guys arm wrestle or what?
 Are you going to do exercises that one?
 No, I just got told what to do.
 So, yeah, so let me dive in here.
 So I came into the business in 2014 or something like that.
 So I'm like, and before then, you know, I was...
 Well, 13, I was still in DC.
 I was still selling everything that we did.
 I was still part time.
 A contractor with them.
 Yes, exactly.
 And then, 14, we moved from DC to down here to Tennessee and here we are.
 So I was, I had been leading.
 I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like
 We could say that.
 Yeah, it's fun.

 We could say you sold some people's livestock.

 So our stuff...
 So our stuff...
 So our stuff
 Yeah...
 We needed an expert...
 And we needed an expert...
 You stepped it in to take care of that.
 Yeah.
 So I stepped in and it...
 At first was a couple of these events and then as things went on we just started growing
 and we were adding more and more events on and we added up...
 And it up adding a coordinator on top of that and so it just grew.
 And part of that was learning how to let go of me owning the live events and actually getting
 outside of that and learning how to lead an event team.
 Yeah...
 I think so a big key thing that we're talking about without saying it is...
 And we teach it all the time here is the duplication process.
 So in those early days there's no possible...
 And again...
 You know when we started this business I thought, "Ah, you know this is going to...
 This is growing and grow a little slow and just had those expectations and it didn't."
 And so that concept of "Well Chris can't do it all."
 There's no possible way that I'm going to be able to do all of this.
 There's no way that I can be on stage and run events.
 There's no way that I can lead the teams that are out there when I'm doing a lot of events.
 And so it became the duplication process.
 How do I duplicate me with you guys?
 And so I think that was a...
 It's so fantastic that we're still sitting here today talking about this as we all love what we do here in our show.
 Blast to be able to do what we do.
 But it was a process.
 Heather, if I'm correct to me from wrong but that was your first leadership role.
 Right.
 That is correct.
 Yeah.
 And so, you know, we've got somebody who's been leading somebody who's brand spanking new in this.
 And what does it look like to raise you guys up to be great leaders of leading the team as we continue to add on?
 So going from there, let's talk about...
 Let's start with the deep dark stuff.
 Ooh, I want to go first.
 You want to do that one?
 Hey Heather, you take it from here.
 That's great. You don't even want to say this.
 I've got to leave.
 Let's talk about struggles.
 The thing we all love to talk about around.
 It's so funny.
 We have a business that is built on learning to how to overcome struggles because we've all been there.
 We've all experienced this.
 You know, that's one of the things that tell people all the time.
 We have this business because I've been through it, and have learned how to overcome this stuff.
 So let's talk about what are some of your leadership struggles early on, maybe mid, maybe nowadays.
 What does that look like?
 Tell some stuff that you struggle with.
 What am I going to go?
 I'm so proud of you.
 You go.
 Go girl.
 Get in there.
 I can run on this question.
 I am a work in progress.
 I think my biggest one that I saw coming in and starting to lead, and even now I see it is the assumption of, oh, I'll just give this peat one.
 It was hard for me to let things go.
 That was the first thing.
 We should probably before we get into this, it would be good for people to understand personality styles.
 My personality style is high sea, and so I needed to control to make sure that everything got done and got done right.
 Yes.
 And so I would take on and not delegate, which is just a whole other mess.
 There we can hold different topic we can talk about.
 So in the beginning it was hard for me to even think about delegating some of those things to other people.
 But then when I started to, then it became the, we'll just do this thing, and I assumed that they had it.
 If you tell them once, they've got it.
 Why don't you have it?
 Like it makes sense what I'm telling you.
 And so it became this process for me of going, hey, don't just assume you really have to get in.
 They really have to get in there and teach and guide and check and inspect and come back.
 And it was this process.
 It wasn't just, oh, now that I'm a leader, I can just give things and delegate them away.
 And it be done.
 I can move on.
 Yeah, so high sea high as personality style.
 A common thing for folks that have been with us for a long time.
 Probably know this, but a count for those that have an a common thing for that high sea personality style is.
 Just giving the small amounts of information to the person when they believe they've got the information.
 It's so funny because high seas.
 If they're speaking to somebody, especially high d, high i.
 If it's somebody they believe doesn't have the information, then they will give ten times the amount of information on it.
 But when leading a lot of times they will lead like seize ten, have a tendency to lead other admin people.
 You had administrative people.
 You've always had administrative people under you as well, but you've, I mean you've had all personality styles.
 But want to see is leading to have a tendency to say something.
 You know, like you just said, here, here's the thing and then have the expectation.
 Well, you're just going to do it.
 You're just going to get it done.
 How did that show up in your leadership?
 Like, what did you see?
 It was a lot of tough conversations.
 And then the beginning leadership lunch.
 Hey, why didn't this thing get done, right?
 You know, and when you say leadership lunch, you're talking about our time as leaders together.
 Yeah, so, you know, every week we have lunch together and part of that is teaching and continuing to learn and grow and.
 And you know what what I was finding was.
 Things weren't getting done, right?
 We'd go into those conversations going, hey, what happened here and my automatic responses.
 Yeah, but I told them what to do and they didn't do it.
 Like, that's not my fault.
 Well, yeah, later it is because you're not leading them.
 And it was a struggle for me because I just wanted to be able to get that thing off my plate and move on.
 And you can't do that in leadership.
 It's a constant, you know, pressing in, growing them and also being able to teach them and not just let out the ropes so that they can hang themselves.
 And that's what I was doing.
 I was just letting it go and not giving any guidance and thinking they had it all together.
 And so when it came down to it, I was failing.
 Well, we always say around here, it's your job as a leader to make your team successful, not the other way around.
 And that was a fantastic learning process in those early days and still to this day.
 I mean, we're constantly growing right.
 What was it like for your team members when you were having to go back and have tough conversations because you had not set them up for success?
 What was that like leading that process?
 High CS, you don't like conflict.
 Right.
 And hey, you're on my leadership team. So welcome conflict is going to happen.
 Right, because we're going to push through this stuff. What was it like for your team?
 Well, one is to my team try to rescue me all the time.
 No, wait.
 You know, oh, Heather, stop.
 You're telling me it's okay.
 No, it's not okay.
 But I think ultimately what happens in that process is you take responsibility as a leader.
 And they start trusting you that hey, she's got my back and she's not going to let me fail.
 And they start pressing in themselves more on growing and learning.
 Versus playing the blame game and you know, them feeling like my gosh, my leader is against me.
 Right.
 I can't do anything right. What am I doing here?
 And how many leaders and you know, we talk about this all the time on the leadership side of the business as we're leading other businesses and their leadership teams and stuff that when you don't do so.
 So first off, you're not setting somebody up for success by telling them to do something.
 And then expecting that they do that.
 That is the number one delegation process by most people on the planet.
 Let me tell you what to do.
 Expect that you do it. Expect that you do it as good as me if not better.
 And when I see that you have completely failed. I take it back.
 So the crazy thing that we miss out on when we're looking at it through that lens is what happens to the people.
 So a lot of sees as is in leadership and anybody in leadership that are not giving good quality direction.
 What we tend to see and I think you saw this in the early days is team members feeling like they were failures because they weren't getting it right.
 Oh and how demotivating is that.
 And it's pointing back to your leadership and setting them up.
 And so it becomes this, you know, it's so funny like you said they're rescuing you in the process.
 You've always had phenomenal, you know, people on the team that just always want to take care of you.
 But what does it do to them? It causes them to believe that they're failures.
 And so how was that in that shifting of way to second?
 A, I took, you know, taking responsibility. One of the things we say around here all the time, you got to take responsibility for what you did.
 My fault, my bad. But here's what we need to do. How did they respond?
 Yeah, again, I think it changes the dynamic of that person when they realize that you're not leaving them out in the dark.
 That you're taking responsibility and you're stepping up to the plate.
 And then when you really do dig in and sit with them and teach them and guide them.
 It just changes their perspective on that trust level that you know, I was seeing them coming to me asking, hey, what about this here? What do I do here? How can you help me with this?
 And versus, oh, I've got to have it all together. I can't let, you know, how they know that I don't know what's going on or what to do here.
 Because they were so afraid of failing that it changed in the sense of, hey, it's okay because I can go and she'll teach and guide.
 Absolutely. And I think, you know, it's been great to see we've had a lot of team members at the boy main group over the years.
 And one of the things I love is how much growth they get personally. I think a lot of folks aren't ready for, you know, coming on board and how much they're going to get.
 But it's phenomenal to see the growth that they get from you guys. I love it. Absolutely.
 Joe, let's talk about some of those early struggles. Sure. As I was just sitting here reflecting, you know, I look back to a lot of a lot of my early struggles.
 I mean, had so much to do with my baggage and a lot of just my junk and just a lot of fear, failure or things where I just would where I wasn't taking responsibility for things that I should have.
 And so much of like of what you teach and why I think that we do operate successfully here is because we push so hard for personal responsibility.
 And you will push for that and you will lead your leaders and lead the team to do that. And I can look back on myself so many times and see it's like you're not taking responsibility.
 So he step up, man, you take that. Chris doesn't have to be the one to do that. He's trying to get that off of him. He's trying to push stuff down and rightfully so.
 You know, we teach killing leadership crazy cycle for a reason is to keep the leadership out of the crazy cycle.
 And so so much of that was very pressing in terms of as the team grew of looking like, okay, what do I need to do? And it was a constant step up step up step up,
 in personal responsibility and the accountability that would be given to make that happen.
 So just a lot of the times just that the fear of failure, just the lack of confidence and certain things that were like,
 what am I, what are we doing here, but really so much of it was just my root system and the immature sides of my high high personality style that would really hold me back.
 That you that you, you know, had to lead me through if I was able to step into just what we're doing today in the responsibility level that we have.
 So I think that's a lot of was some of my just main stuff.
 I was comparisons to leading, you know, being under leaders before.
 Gosh, how do I say this? What's the difference in, you know, struggles you had at other places, compared to stepping in here? What was it?
 You know, it's it's I have to really things about that was I have to really like search back and look at like when I failed.
 And when I had conversations because environments and all my work environments in the past that it's a lot like what we see with our clients today is that their biggest struggles are often lacks of leadership,
 lacks of great communication, a lack of great accountability, just the level of leadership that we teach isn't common at all.
 And so that's a lot of what I experienced. So there was a lot of stuff that, you know, I think that I failed, but there was no one really there to talk to me about it or hold me accountable to it.
 As on the nose as we are on things here, how much more communication leadership accountability driven that we are, that breeds success.
 But it will often help people see, maybe this isn't the culture for me, but I would have it know other way, I mean period.
 It's like when I, you know, the conversation we had when I was coming we were visiting when we were still in DC and I told you that's like man, there's there's no one else I would leave everything I'm doing to come work with other than you,
 because I knew you as a friend and I knew like I'd followed on trade leadership for years and I just knew you and knew what kind of a leader and I was like that's what I want to do.
 And that's what I want to be a part of and there's a great level of trust that was already there.
 And so here, boom, now I'm in the environment and it's like, "Oh, this is the real deal. I'm hanging out. You're going to be led."
 That's right, you're going to be led for a long time.
 But for you, it's just how you do it. It's just, well, that's just how you do it. We do what we teach here.
 It's like, "Do we fail all the time as a team? We fail all the time. We do what we teach though. We do what we teach."
 And so it's like, "Okay, I'm really now in that."
 So I mean, just looking back, I think that there were failures of like boy, hey, that was a bad decision.
 Why did we do it that way? But I think looking back, there was a lot of just a lack of leading people and holding them accountable.
 That I think it would have looked a lot different in my career prior to being here.
 Absolutely. All right, when we come back after this, we're going to talk about accountability. We'll see you in just a second.
 Hey, leaders. This is Joel Fortner, VP, a leadership development at Crystal Cardinals company.
 I have some questions for you. Do you as a leader feel like you are caught up in a crazy cycle of stress and tasks that never ends week to week?
 Do you ever have to deal with tough conversations with team members?
 And you sit at home the next day, the night before worried about how's it going to go? What am I going to say? What are they going to say?
 Can I think fast enough on my feet? Is it going to be a total failure?
 Are you experiencing culture problems or that stuff that just breaks down trust and unity on your team?
 Well, if you can relate to any of this, this is a pretty typical leadership story in situation.
 Here's the thing though. It doesn't have to be that way and we can help you solve these things.
 We can help you become the leader that solves these problems and leads their team to greater success.
 I want to introduce you to the key leaders program.
 This is an ongoing leadership development program that gives you the less-intract coaching and accountability you need to become the leader you can become
 to actually implement what you're actually learning in this program.
 Things fall apart without great leadership and intentionality.
 If you want to solve the problems that are holding you back from being a great leader, we can help you with this program,
 get in touch with Joel@Christlacardo.com.

 Alright, we are back and here's a question I've got for you because of stuff that you just, you guys both just mentioned in the last section here.
 What is it been like stepping into this kind of accountability?
 We say it all the time.
 Number one issue every business has a lack of high levels of quality communication.
 We see it all the time. We see it in all the companies that we lead.
 We see it in strap line. We see it everywhere.
 We see it in our membership programs.
 It's a number one issue. Number two is a very close one right behind that is a lack of accountability.
 If you don't understand accountability, you just, there's no possible way you can have it.
 At least people understand the need for communication, but they just don't know how to do it.
 That is a massive focus on what we do here.
 Through personality styles, through values, through just being on top of stuff.
 But all of that comes with accountability.
 So here's my question stepping into this.
 What's it been like experiencing the accountability here that you guys have experienced?
 Hard. It was hard.
 Yeah, I would say painful.
 My high eye that times in the beginning hated it.
 And it hated it to the point of losing worth being out of control, being a victim, being defensive, all that crap.
 But I was my problem.
 You're simply trying to lead and I'm totally freaking out because I'm not accustomed to that.
 And all of a sudden it's like, hey, this is a thing here, man.
 It's like you need to see this little loan to my next level of life training.
 That's a whole other thing.
 But just being here, it was hard at first because of what I struggled with personally.
 It's amazing that not everybody makes it here.
 Accountability can rule people out.
 And before, well, before I go further on that, how do you answer?
 You said painful.
 Yeah, mine was pretty close.
 I would say it was painful. It was a painful process because of my root system, because of my personality style.
 I had the need to be right.
 I felt like a horrible person, you know, and so there was this defensiveness that would happen.
 And I definitely would make I needed a villain because I felt like a victim.
 And so you became that villain in that process.
 And so it was still Mary's painful.
 I'm still blessed and still curious as to, no, it was painful and tough, right?
 Yeah.
 So why? Here's the question. Why?
 What specifically was so tough?
 Like, you're saying, you're saying it's a trigger for me that I'm regardless if it's what you're sending or not.
 I'm receiving your a failure.
 And for me, it's like, oh, I've disappointed Chris, or I got this thing wrong.
 And so now I'm a failure. So here comes loss of self-worth out of control.
 And then here come a myriad of surface level responses of, well, now I'm just going to fight.
 Or now I'm just going to defend or I'm just going to become a victim or whatever it may be, because it's all self-protection.
 Because I can't fail, right? It's I can't fail. There's a massive fear of failure because of what it represents in your eyes.
 Is, oh, I'm letting Chris down. I've failed him. Oh, he's going to think I'm not smart enough to do the job. Oh, he's not going to think I actually am capable of coaching people because I'm failing.
 And it was all just self-sabotage. But it's like, I mean, I'm the kid that used to run around the playground thinking, oh, so highly of himself, that if I failed you,
 I would say, I'll be your best friend. If we just just make it, like, I'm very, like, here are the ego in the six year old Joel back then.
 Like, let me offer you myself to make a men's with you.
 It's like, I could, I've never been able to stand failure, but I look back and I've never had the mentoring and the coaching like I've had here in order to learn about myself.
 Deeper, learn all the stuff, the faith journey, the accountability to be able to work past this stuff today, rock and self-manage so much more effectively.
 Oh, great questions popping up on my head. How about you?
 Yeah, I would say, dido on that. I think for me, a big piece was the disappointment, but the other big piece was what I was trained in the past.
 And how it felt, you know, in the past, it was a, either I'm trying to take you down a notch or I'm trying to get one up on you.
 And so, speaking to people in your personal life that you used to, instead of instead of being accountability used control and manipulation.
 Right, under the disguise of accountability. And so it wasn't healthy. And so when I came into this, you know, instinct is, oh, this is bad, your horrible person.
 And, you know, like I said earlier, you became that villain to me.
 So here's what's great. Here's what I can't, because this sounds horrible.
 I don't like it. If I'm on the other side of this, wow, my gosh, this kind of was beat them with so not at all.
 Given example of what the accountability was.
 So let's take an early example of like you could see that we were heading down a path of failing on a project.
 But the failure wasn't going to be so big that you were like, no, I can't stop. I have to stop this, not what this happened.
 You would let things run out and you'd be like, watch this is going to what's going to happen.
 And then it would happen. And then it would be a, what are we learning here, guys? What are you seeing? What are you not doing?
 Remember we talked about this and I said this, this and this did it happen? Nope. Nope. Why didn't it happen?
 I don't know. And but then it would be this is why it didn't happen. This is why it didn't happen.
 And there were those, but there was no beating up. There was a, I'm going to let you guys walk into this failure because you need to learn need to experience it.
 That's just one example. But in that place of now having that conversation with you, it's easy to get triggered and now be the, well, well, well, well, well,
 did it with this and well, what about this and well, and here's all this defensiveness. That's all self protection. And you have to, you don't learn. I didn't, I didn't have the tools and the perspective I have now, you know, years later,
 you don't realize in the moment like, Joe, look how you're being in this conversation. You're just making it worse on you.
 Chris is sitting here, discarding you and asking you questions and you're freaking out about it.
 Yeah, yeah, oh, gosh. So what's good stuff? I can't ask you. How they're about you?
 So, one that comes to mind was, it had was event related and it was that same, that that concept of, well, I'll just give this task to somebody and they'll just do it and they'll do it with excellence and I don't have to guide or lead the process.
 And we show up the day of the event or no, I think it was the night before we discovered this failure that had happened.
 And we had to run it's course like we had to fix it on the fly, but I remember getting back into the office that following Monday and walking through that process, hey, what, what happened. Why did this happen?
 Our fixed process, our solution process. You know, and I had to take responsibility on shoot because I just gave the task and didn't lead the process as well.
 So, question, did I repeat your heads on? No, because it sounds like that, right?
 It's what it can, it's what it can sound like. But here's as we talk about this and reflect on this, I think about, you know, what's the context of what we're talking about today, raising up leaders.
 But you're talking a lot of the stuff we're talking about is like, if had we, have we not done this and if you had not led in this way, would we be able to be the leaders that we are today?
 No, would we be able to do this with our teams today?
 No, absolutely not. That's what I want to know is like, what is it you guys have been through this and again, we're not talking about anything huge here, but we do operate with the phenomenal excellence.
 Once again, because of the accountability and the excellence that we have here, some folks don't want that. They can't handle that. That's not something that they want.
 They want to be able to hide, they want to be able to get away with stuff. We want to change lives. We want to help people. We want to grow people starting with the people inside of the building.
 So with situations like this, when you look back on it and the personal struggle you've experienced in the accountability, right? That I'm the one struggling with stuff.
 Like I always, I love sharing a story of one of the three of us, or Heather now, we're having a conversation over in the kitchen at the counter and talking about something you came downstairs and I'd said to myself, I'm a head okay, I need to ask Joel to do something inside of his next level lives.
 But if he's struggling right now, I don't want to get the push back on it and I said, Joel, you probably already do this, but I need you to do this this and this and you said, okay.
 And then Heather, I went back on with our conversation and then you went, hey man, don't do that. You don't need to do that.
 And I'm like, what? Because I know exactly why you just, you, I hit him. You're right here speaking of you and the third person.
 You said, I know exactly why you just did that and listen, if I'm going to struggle, I'm going to struggle, let me have it.
 And I'm like, you get extra hugs today because it was just such a fantastic moment.
 And a scone. And a scone. Yeah.
 That's really a scone by the problem.
 And I love hugs. I love guns.
 It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one.
 It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one.
 It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one.
 It's, I just noticed my leader teed up something because of my own personal struggles.
 And here's the great thing you said, I don't want that.
 Nope. That's not something that I want. I don't want that in my life.
 If I'm going to struggle, let me struggle because I'm going to grow.
 So it's just so powerful to see you guys step up into, hey, here's something that's rolling.
 Here's something that's not working.
 And we always have the same process. What happened? How did it happen? What did it happen?
 How do we fix it? How do we make sure it never happens again? Same thing we do all the time.
 And from there, you guys are leading other people.
 So what is, here's what I want to know. What is it been like leading that accountability process?
 Because you can't save your team, right? I didn't save you guys.
 I didn't rip your heads off, but I didn't save you from experiencing those hard moments.
 Which is why you guys are great leaders. So what was that like when you turned around and started leading accountability inside of the company?
 Yeah, I'll go. I mean, there are times looking back in like years ago, especially that that I could see how, yep, you were being a people, please, you're here.
 Yeah, you weren't leading that strong enough yet. You didn't gain enough perspective. All the struggles and things.
 It's not like, oh, I've experienced this from Chris. Now I'm going to go do it perfectly.
 But I was a whole lot better. I was a whole lot better as a result of it.
 And then we've just continued to grow and get better.
 But still there were a lot of a lot of failures.
 There are times I'd reflect on a conversation and be like, now that could have done, I could have done better than that.
 Or I can see how just might wanting to avoid conflict can show up in a conversation.
 So that stuff's still there because I'm still high.
 But even though I said things like what you were just saying about, hey, man, I don't need the tee up.
 Because I recognize what you're doing.
 You know, I still have struggles. You know, is that I'm not perfect.
 And I still struggle through things. And I know, you know, Heather will share the same.
 And but I compare myself as that we're on a journey here is like, I love the book mindset.
 It's about effort. It's not about just natural talent.
 It's about are you going to put in the effort and the practice to get better because you want to get better.
 Not because anyone's holding a gun to your head. Never once did you ever say, you're going to be a freaking leader.
 And that's just how it's going to be. And you're going to be at this level. Never once. It's a you in this culture.
 You can do whatever you want. You can go as far as you want to go.
 It's totally up to you.
 And we see potential in people and just as we see potential in one another.
 But at the end of the day, we have to choose it. Well, I'm just I'm the kind of guy that's like if I'm going to set my mind to something, I'm going to do it.
 I'm going to make that happen even though it's difficult and painful.
 That's just been the mindset behind it. But man, early days looking back on it.
 You know, it was awesome. But looking back and comparing even now to then.
 I mean, it's been a mile, long journey and it just keeps getting better.
 And you do more than anything. So well, let me come back to that.
 You want to hear Heather side of this. What what did you, what was it like when you turned around and started doing our style of accountability with your team?
 Well, I think what it did was I was no longer the bad person.
 And so that was always a tough one for me because I wanted them to like me.
 And I didn't want to be that mean, you know, leader that was horrible.
 I didn't want to come into work because she was horrible.
 And so the way that we operate our culture and the leadership here is we do have our team's best interests at heart.
 And we do truly want to see them succeed and we care about them.
 And so when you step back and you approach that team member about the thing and not them as a person failing,
 then you're no longer the bad person and you can walk through the thing together.
 And so kind of let's explain the bad person concept because I think a lot of people might get that as you said that,
 but well, think about it in parenting.
 When somebody's not doing something right, you feel out of control.
 So if it's a child, they're not, they haven't cleaned up their room.
 They haven't done the dishes. If it's a team member, they haven't done the thing that you task them to do.
 They've not done it the correct way. They've failed at something again.
 The struggle inside is the crap.
 I now have to be a bad person. I've got to go, why did you do this? Why aren't you doing this or and be that negative bad person,
 which is the opposite of what we teach.
 We teach if you actually hold people accountable if you've taught them well, so what we always say,
 which is great for us to run through, where we say as a leader you always look at you first.
 You know, I've always pushed you guys whenever we're talking through a struggle that a team member is having.
 I always go, well, what did you do? Where's your failure in this?
 Take a look at you first. If you can look through and go, man, I 100% led this well,
 which sometimes you can't, right? Sometimes you got to go.
 Yeah, I didn't. Let me go back. I got to go fix this.
 But when you can say, no, I've done this. I've led this. We've been through this.
 Then what happens is you get to use that accountability of help me to understand why this is this way.
 Instead of the, what we see in most, if not almost all businesses in leadership issues, why are you doing this?
 You're screwing this up, you're failing at this and then that bad person comes out.
 It's like being that bad parent to the kid who still has an cleaned up their room.
 So that's kind of what you experience is that, oh, crud, I don't like the conflict.
 I have to build my stuff. Correct me for what?
 Yeah, and I still don't like the conflict.
 I mean, I still, you know, it's still a battle for me because I, you know, it comes up.
 Like Joel said, you still, it doesn't go away. You just, you know that you have to switch the way you approach things
 and the team knows that. If you've trained your team and you've led your team in that culture of,
 hey, we all care for one another and we're in this together.
 They'll receive it differently. They receive it differently. And so.
 So what did you, so what did you do more in the early days of holding your team accountable?
 Did you rescue more or did you hold back more or what do you think the thing was as you were starting to implement this,
 that you struggled with yourself?
 Gosh, I don't know if there was more than one another about us know all of it was there.
 I know that there, I know there would have been rescuing.
 I know there would have been holding back. There's sometimes would have been just, you know,
 this my skills today are not what they were then. So there's sometimes it's like,
 how do I have this conversation? Like what do I do? But a lot of it is,
 it's getting out of your own way because you're being a people pleaser or the mece to speak about myself,
 since I was a or doing here, as being a people pleaser or fear of conflict and there's worth coming from a person,
 and you're wanting the relationship to be intact when it's so, and it's all set and done,
 and all this stuff, all lies that you tell yourself whatever it may be.
 That holds you back from leading a person well.
 But I love where Heather, diswent, and her response was to,
 is that if you have a culture of people caring about each other, you have great trust.
 And when there's great trust, you as a leader know, I can lead this person on that,
 and it's all going to be okay. And the team member knows, my leader has my best interest at heart,
 they're not telling me I'm a bad person, this is all going to be okay.
 I want to be great things to see, because we do accountability and public. We'll do the team meetings and stuff like that,
 if it's not something that's ridiculous, if it's not something that's going to embarrass the daylights out of somebody,
 obviously we don't want to do that, but there's times that we will call situations out
 that are great, teachable moments for mercy and distract a little bit and grow,
 which is one of my favorite things to watch is that, "Oh crap, this,
 I can lose worth right now, this can be embarrassing, this can be a struggle or I could take responsibility."
 And when you see them take responsibility, it's just phenomenal. I love it.
 Erin West asked the question, "Have you ever cloned yourself?"
 And I had to stop and think and go, "No, I've never cloned me currently."
 And I said, "There's interesting thing about the question that you're asking is,
 "I've cloned myself at different times of me, but I keep growing.
 I have been growing as a leader for almost the years."
 I've been growing as a leader for 30 years, 29 years,
 and so raising up leaders and training them, it's always training them to become better.
 And then the great thing is, is that I'm always constantly growing as well.
 So it's been a phenomenal process. Well, while we are not even remotely close to done,
 we're going to be done with this episode. For today, we have so much more that we are going to hit.
 So we will continue on next week. Anything you guys want to leave our fantastic followers with?
 Yeah, I think I have one thing is that it popped in my mind earlier as we were talking.
 And I think a key to just a mindset, as if you're a leader being raised up by another leader out there right now,
 or you're a leader raising up leaders.
 You want to teach them one thing I think hugely important is asking yourself,
 "Why did I need to be led on that?"
 Right. Because it's a question that pushes you toward personal responsibility.
 So it's, why did Chris need to lead me on that?
 Because if there is a situation where you're doing it, because you're looking to learn from where your failures are,
 but it goes back to your, some of your greatest growth involves your mindset and what you believe.
 Yeah, it really helps you to notice if yourself protective, you can't answer that.
 You can ask that question. If you're defensive, you can ask that question.
 The person who wants to really grow can look at the situation and go like you said,
 "Okay, he just led me on that. She just led me on that. I obviously needed to be led on that why."
 What am I missing in my leadership that I didn't see that ahead of time and I didn't pick that up ahead of time.
 Everybody's doing, everybody's the early days of leadership.
 So, however you mentioned our leadership lunches every week, we get together for two and a half hours, sometimes three hours.
 We go to lunch because we need to eat, but we go through so much stuff.
 And that's my time leading you guys, that's our time of discussing through problem situations, you know, upcoming stuff.
 And I'll never forget years ago, Heather was saying something. She was talking to you.
 I don't even remember what the thing was.
 I do remember what it was, I don't remember what it was.
 I said, because you said something that I just liked that you had Joel said, "You already know what he's gonna ask you."
 You know what's coming, which is gonna be what? How do you think you should do that?
 Because it is not, you know, I love helping people, my gosh.
 Over the decades, it is so much better to help somebody be able to solve something on their own than to give the answer.
 Folks, that's so important for you to understand. It is so much better to help somebody come up with the answer.
 If your identity is totally in you solving problems and you having the answers, then you're never gonna create great leaders.
 Ooh, we'll have to start the next episode on that as well.
 If your identity and your worth is in you solving problems for your team, you will never raise up great leaders.
 You will probably lose people who could have been great leaders because they need to be the ones that solve the problem and then pass it on.
 Your identity can't be in that. Let your identity and your worth to the company be in making them great.
 Well folks, hopefully this has helped you. Today we're gonna come back next week with a lot more of this as you join us on the next episode.
 So take this information, change your leadership, change your business, change your life and join us on the next episode.
