 You know, a difference in the Greeks and the Jews in our Western way and the Middle
 Eastern way of the Bible is the Greeks being philosophers.
 You learn sitting down.
 You know, we sit in desk.
 We read books.
 They're a writing culture.
 For the Jews, you learn in your body.
 It's through a bodymen.
 If you're a disciple of Jesus, you are not sitting at a desk taking notes.
 You are walking with him.
 You are being covered in the dust of your rabbi.
 You're following him and he's teaching as he goes.
 Welcome to the Crystal Cardo Show where we discuss leadership and life and discover
 that business is what you do, not who you are.
 Well folks, welcome to the show.
 Today I am crazy excited because joining me in this studio is the brilliant Christy McLean.
 Welcome to the show, Christy.
 Thank you, Christ.
 Thanks for having me today.
 This is a great dear friend of mine.
 We have known each other for literally decades.
 We go back away and have had a phenomenal trip recently where we went.

 It is wrong.
 It is just not complete understanding.
 There are so many things by not understanding the culture, understanding the words that
 when you do all of a sudden there is this amazing richness.
 God's word is fantastic already in the way that we teach it here in a Western culture.
 Then when you see it, literally live down, understand the culture.
 It becomes so much more powerful in your life.
 So going over there for us, I couldn't say about a word than adventure.
 It was a really cool great thing because we are going to do this phenomenal Bible study where
 we hit four to five stops every single day and just really digging the God's word.
 You get to see it.
 All of a sudden, just like you said, that pilgrimage concept, that moving from strength to strength,
 it felt like every day you would literally move from strength to strength.
 I mean, there are pieces that as you are going along at the same time, for me, I don't know
 about everybody else on the trip, but there is a morning I just lost it.
 There was so much stuff that God was just shelving into me at one time.
 I am seeing your love so greater than I have ever experienced before.
 For me that was another strength of okay.
 Let's move in this direction here.
 All of that said, I completely agree, phenomenal adventure.
 Pilgrimage is something that all I can do is think about what's next.
 What are we going to do next?
 So all of that to build into what we're talking about today, which is that leadership through
 that Middle Eastern lens, the very first meeting that we had about going to over there.
 I don't remember exactly what I said that brought this up, but you're like, God's going
 to give you a word.
 It's going to give you a word, and the Hebrew way is the divar in the mid bar, which that
 means that going out to the wilderness.
 This is not going to translate unless we explain all that.
 So what is the mid bar talk about that, talk about how that comes about?
 So a little bit about West versus East or our western way versus the Middle Eastern way to
 lead into this.
 As an American people, we are infinitely more Athens and Rome than we are Jerusalem.
 We are infinitely more Greco, Roman, and our cultural norms than we are Jewish.
 My specialty in Bible teaching, I'm known as a biblical culturalist.
 And what that means is I teach the Bible through its original historical, cultural, geographical,
 and linguistic context.
 I function like a time machine.
 I want to take you back 2,000 years to the first century world of Jesus.
 Take you back 3,000 years, 3500 years.
 It's getting to know Jesus.
 It's getting to know the patriarchs in their world, in their day, in their time.
 One of the things I learned in Israel that encouraged me so much is the Greeks were philosophers.
 It's all about ideas and learning the acquisition of knowledge.
 The Greeks loved knowledge, but the Hebrews have always loved the light, the light of the revelation,
 of the living God through the story of the Bible.
 So shifting from being one who's trying to acquire knowledge for knowledge, sake, to seeking
 to receive revelation for transformation, sake, has literally been changing my life for the last 12 years.
 And in Israel, when you talk about where do you go to get your word, the Hebrew word for
 word is devar.
 And the word for wilderness or desert is midbar.
 There's a phrase in the Middle East that you go into the midbar to get your devar.
 You go into the wilderness to get your word from the Lord.
 And you say, "Christie, how do you see this?"
 Playing itself out in Scripture, it was in the midbar in Exodus chapter 3, where Moses
 interacts with the living God through the burning bush.
 Elijah flees to the midbar after defeating the prophets of Baal in Ashera.
 And it's in the midbar that he hears the still small voice.
 Right after Jesus' baptism and the gospel is the Bible says the Spirit of God led him into
 the desert.
 Why after baptism he's going into the midbar to get his devar to get his word in the wilderness.
 And we are a people who love to avoid the wilderness.
 We love to avoid the desert.
 But a Middle Eastern people, that's the rich place.
 That's where you go to get your word.
 I heard a rabbi say, "Once God does his best work in the wilderness."
 He does his best work in the desert.
 And we're always asking the question, "How do I get out of this wilderness season?
 How do I get out of this desert?"
 But in the biblical world they would say the better question is not, "How do I get out of this?"
 But how do I carry the wilderness with me for the rest of my life?
 What am I getting while I'm here?
 You took us into the wilderness.
 It's amazing.
 We use that term wilderness in a western culture and you just think of crazy wild stuff.
 Anything goes.
 Really, that's also the way that it is over there as well.
 You don't really know.
 But for us being in that wilderness when we traveled all the way out to it and then we got
 down in it.
 You mentioned in the Christ God's going to give you a word.
 It's so funny how God works.
 As I'm going through this process and not only do we go down into the mid-bar and have study
 and learn and take a look around and understand what this is like and understand what the
 Psalmist is talking about about walking through the valley of the shadow of death.
 This is that place at any moment.
 Flash floods can happen.
 All kinds of bad stuff can happen in this place.
 This is a place that God really truly meets people and guides people through this process.
 Then we climb out.
 We have this phenomenal hike.
 I don't remember what the distance was.
 It was pretty fantastic and insane of just climbing, climbing and looking at everything around
 us.
 As I came out, everybody, you know, they're not everybody.
 But a lot of people were talking about this is what I just received down there.
 It people are experiencing and I'm going, where's my word?
 Like I've been waiting on this thing for a year.
 We're God and I was praying the whole time and all this.
 So I'm like, okay, well, you're God.
 You have something for me either I'm not hearing it or I'm missing it.
 Whatever it is, my trust is a new, my faith is a new.
 Then we roll on to another site where when I was listening that place was this hospitality,
 this lesson of hospitality.
 We don't understand how important hospitality is in a Western culture to God.
 In an Eastern culture, it is vital.
 There's a lot of scriptures that we don't understand while people choose to protect a
 foreigner even over their own family and not realizing that that is this call of, this is
 your protection.
 You have to do this.
 You have to take care of this.
 Because we're going through this process.
 We have our bathroom breaks and this family, I looked over and I saw this family roll up
 and they all got out and they're at these picnic tables and it was a father, mother and
 older daughter, a middle son and a younger daughter.
 And the older daughters over there just doing this little routine, like a dance routine, she
 must do it school or something like that and just thought to myself, that's fun.
 They're just having this great family time out here.
 We go to the restroom and as I'm leaving, I hear this sit down.
 Okay, so I just sat down and it's like five minutes at a stand up and turn around.
 I stand up and turn around and here is that father.
 And all of a sudden I see literally lived out before me.
 Here's this Palestinian Muslim who steps up and is just like, hey, where are you from?
 How's it going?
 It starts this conversation.
 You know, you don't know what to say.
 What, how do you handle the situation?
 And I remember just going, how do I be as vague as possible about what we're doing?
 I don't want to be offensive.
 I don't want to say anything that sets them off or anything like that.
 And I'm just like, well, we're just here learning your history and he goes, oh, it's all
 of our history, man.
 And boom, it was just this hit of here is somebody who, in a Western culture, would be the
 person we would say, nope, stay away from this person.
 You don't understand them.
 This is bad.
 And he loved on me.
 His older daughter runs over.
 Start saying now, she doesn't speak in English, but she wanted to find out what's going on.
 The next kid comes up.
 The next kid comes up and it just becomes just amazing time of watching this lived out.
 And it's like, God, go, do you have your word now?
 Do you understand?
 This is what I'm looking for you to discover.
 That's incredible.
 So just that powerful moment of going, okay, and we're pretty hospitable people here.
 We have people in all the time, we're constantly taking care of them.
 But it was as if God was saying, I want you to see there's more to it than you think.
 And it's not just a specific people.
 This is important to me.
 So that was such a big piece for me coming out of that wilderness of going, okay?
 Because since then he's been dropping all kinds of stuff in my life.
 So you just talked about how here we try to avoid the wilderness and how we try to get
 out of it and everything.
 How do you walk out lessons coming out of the mid-bar?
 How do you take that kind of stuff for the lessons that you're experiencing and how do you
 walk that out in your life?
 In the church, we talk about spiritual disciplines and spiritual rhythms, prayer, Bible study,
 going to church, tithing, serving on missions.
 But for 2000 years, Pilgrimage has been considered as a spiritual discipline and rhythm of
 the church.
 And the question becomes, why are the disciplines given to us because God wants us to follow
 rules or is he getting at something completely different?
 And one of the things I learned in Israel is all of the spiritual disciplines, all the spiritual
 rhythms, all the things that we do as a people living in the way of Jesus.
 It's not about following rules.
 It's about creating space for what and for who.
 And all the disciplines they serve as a way for us to create space for God to come in and fill
 it.
 I heard a counselor say to me one time, "Christie, you can't give what you don't have."
 And I think sometimes as leaders, as shepherds, as pastors, and whatever role we serve
 sometimes we try to give from what we don't have.
 And I think that maybe the mid-bar is one of the places of our greatest inheritance.
 It's where God seeks to deposit things into our forever stories, into our forever journeys.
 It's a place of aid, it's a place of equipping, it's a place of strengthening.
 I know in my own life I enjoy the easy times, but I honestly don't tend to learn a lot from
 them.
 I start learning quickly, rapidly, vericiously when things are going wrong, when things are hard.
 That's more what has shaped me, what has formed me.
 And over the last 12 years, I've come to love the mid-bar.
 I love taking teams down into the wilderness of Zen and taking that hike up and out of it.
 A difference in the Greeks and the Jews and our Western way and the Middle Eastern way of the Bible
 is the Greeks being philosophers.
 You learn sitting down.
 We sit in desk.
 We read books.
 They're a writing culture.
 For the Jews you learn in your body.
 It's through a body man.
 You're a disciple of Jesus.
 You are not sitting at a desk taking notes.
 You are walking with him.
 You are being covered in the dust of your rabbi.
 You're following him and he's teaching as he goes.
 And I've learned that for me it's such a better way to learn who the living God is, who he is.
 And my everyday life of Dustin Ruann is I get up and go to work and live my everyday normal
 Monday through Sunday.
 It's the way that God meets me.
 It's these intersections.
 And I've learned to love the mid-bar.
 I cannot wait to take teams.
 You think about the temple mount.
 You think about places like Bethlehem and Nazareth.
 Places that people love to go.
 But when I take teams to Israel, one of my favorite days is taking them into the mid-bar.
 Because I really do believe it's a gift given to them.
 And it's creating that space for the living God to speak, to say what He wants to say,
 to do what He wants to do and a way none of us can control and some ancient way and a way none of us
 want to control.
 Because He's doing more than we could ever ask.
 I imagine.
 It's so important to understand that the struggles, the mid-bar, the suffering, like you
 pointed out, the stuff that I teach here, it's so funny when people come through and they
 start to hear about my failures.
 If we're doing an event or something like that, and I start talking about failures, people are
 like, oh, praise God.
 And it's like, praise God, what?
 I'm just glad to know that you failed.
 I'm like, are you kidding?
 Everything I teach is from learning from failure.
 I failed a ton of times.
 I've screwed so much stuff up.
 It's ridiculous.
 There's not, I don't have a count.
 God has that count.
 I couldn't even count up the times I screwed up.
 It's the learning.
 It's the suffering that I've been through and learning out of it.
 It's the stupid decisions that I've made in learning from it that allows me to teach and grow people.
 So yours is a five to one.
 I think on my failure stupid ratio, it's probably about a 20 to one.
 I love that that's an accident.
 That's right.
 Yes.
 I screw up about 20 times and I teach somebody what not to do.
 Salt the like that.
 But I think it's so powerful.
 Like as people go through next level of life or as teams are coming in through here as leadership
 teams.
 One of the things we show them is do not and James talks about this.
 Don't ask God to stop the crap.
 Don't ask him to stop what you're in.
 You have to change your mindset.
 Your mindset needs to be focused on, okay, I'm in it.
 If God does take me out of it right away, what's my benefit?
 I could say that I want through something difficult.
 But if I stay right here knowing that he is the God of the universe, he's not surprised
 I'm in this junk or this mess or I've made this stupid decision.
 If I trust him and I realize that he's aware, then that means he has a plan.
 It's a better process.
 He has something he's wanting to show me.
 He's wanting to teach me.
 He's wanting to release me from many times that of struggle and suffering.
 I've actually walked away getting rid of bad decision making or bad situations or any
 kind of stuff.
 And so I think it's so powerful that as we walk through and we're talking about the wilderness,
 that was one of, I don't know, 40, 50, I don't even know what's the number of spots that we
 hit.
 It's around 66.
 It's at 66 spots that we hit.
 I didn't even think about that.
 That's one spot of all these different places that we just dig in and learn and grow and
 just so crazy powerful.
 One of the things I think that's so important in a biblical understanding of the midbar
 is oftentimes in our lives.
 I don't know if you do this, but I've certainly done it.
 When things get hard, I start asking God where are you?
 There's almost this sense of the absence of God when things are going south and it's
 encouraged me so much when you look through the biblical narrative, the Israelites wondered
 in the desert for 40 years and God wondered with them.
 He literally said, "Build me a tabernacle because I'm going to live out this desert
 experience with an among you.
 God promises to enter into our chaos to bring order.
 He promises to enter into our brokenness to bring restoration and renewal.
 He takes what is crooked and makes it straight.
 He takes what is high and lowers it so that we can walk.
 He takes what's low and raises it.
 He is the one who sets a sure path for us.
 And so I've learned when things start going south and when things aren't going well,
 it's like Lord if the Bible is true at all.
 You are present with me in this situation and this experience and this trauma and this hurt
 and these tough decisions that I have to make.
 And it's changed it for me.
 I don't feel alone.
 I don't feel like I'm left to myself.
 I've learned to look for the living God in the mid-bar and to actively pray for my devar.
 And I would say that so much of the wisdom that finds me because we never go get wisdom.
 Sometimes it comes to us.
 It comes in the mid-bar and so it's been a gift, a pearl that I've wanted to bring back to the
 West, just encourage us in our own day and our own time, whatever we're doing that when things
 go south, God is there with and among us.
 He doesn't mind walking in dust and ruin.
 He's done it before.
 He keeps asking for it.
 And he keeps saying, "Hey, if you will come this direction, I will be with you in this."
 Just come this direction.
 It's funny.
 A lot of people will go through next to the life when we talk through the God thing.
 We'll have folks that come through that are Christians, we'll have people that aren't believers
 at all that go through this process.
 And when we talk about the God thing with believers or non believers, if they want to talk
 about it, one of the things that we help them to see is we have this belief system that
 if I do good, God gives me good.
 If I do bad, God gives me bad.
 It's this transactional God.
 Bad is because bad, if I'm going through something bad, I must have been doing something bad.
 And if things are going really well, then man, I must be phenomenal.
 God's really impressed with me, right?
 Not happening.
 So the interesting thing that I help people to see is how many times throughout the Bible
 it's the exact opposite.
 God is actually choosing to a honest.
 That's not that it doesn't happen.
 I'm sure.
 You do bad, you get consequences, choices and consequences.
 Choose bad decisions, you get bad consequences.
 Choose good ones, you get good ones.
 But many times God allows good people to go through struggles so that he builds them up.
 It makes them stronger on the backside.
 Kind of talk about where you see that in leadership or how does that apply from that Eastern
 lens to this Western lens?
 I'm getting so excited right now.
 In the rabbinics, they talk about stringing the pearls together that every biblical story is
 like a great pearl.
 It's beautiful, it's a great price.
 But what's more beautiful than a pearl, it's a string of pearls together making a beautiful
 necklace.
 And when you look at the ancient world, the biblical world, it's patriarchal.
 The pothare, the father, has the highest honor, the highest premium.
 The firstborn son has pream minutes.
 And yet with all of that being said, when you go all the way back to the origin of the story,
 back to the genesis, literally the first book of the Bible, Genesis means origin or beginnings.
 It tends to be the second son that gets chosen.
 God loves the underdog.
 He's been choosing the underdog from the very beginning.
 It wasn't ishmail, it was Isaac.
 It wasn't esau, it was Jacob.
 It was the one that was on and on and on.
 The city of Jerusalem, Zion, the epicenter of the world for the Jewish people.
 It's the most unlikely place to make your capital for your nation.
 It's easily invaded, always from the north, by the way.
 Water is only found at the Gehonspring, so you have to channel it into the city.
 So it's so beautiful that God didn't choose a city where his name would dwell right along the
 Nile River, where water is so plentiest, or somewhere else.
 No it's Jerusalem.
 It's in the middle of the desert, where the city dwells that carries God's name, not because it
 has everything right.
 But because it lives in this dynamic powerlessness, this active dependence on the living God
 to provide the sun and the rain for its sustainability.
 That's a lesson for all of us.
 So you just spoke at one of our retreats here for our next level Mastermind group.
 Our full, it was so fun.
 I want to was great to bring this back to a bunch of leaders to learn this stuff.
 The topics that we want to hit is immense and insane.
 One of the things that you hit and you're going to be, well, the great thing is you're
 going to be speaking at our next level leadership live event in May.
 Excited about that.
 Can not wait for that.
 But one of the things you hit was this phenomenal story about the good I.
 Now, as it's preached here and in the West, it's usually preached as something else.
 But you bring this phenomenal revelation to people talk about that a little bit.
 You know, the interesting thing about words is they have meaning.
 They do.
 They do.
 And different cultures use words in different ways.
 And in our English language, English is a noun based language.
 But Hebrew is a verb based language.
 It's all in the action.
 It's the action that's the subject of a sentence.
 And so one of the things when I'm teaching Bible here, I love to point out some examples in
 the Bible where we read it as Westerners.
 And we see words that we would define in a certain way.
 But the question becomes, how did the biblical authors mean it when they used those words
 when Jesus is talking?
 What does he mean by the words in terms that he's using?
 And in Matthew 567, we have the most famous sermon ever preached or ever written down.
 We call it the sermon on the Mount and write in the heart of it in Matthew chapter.
 That's right.
 You were there.
 God was there.
 And Matthew chapter 6 verses 22 and 23.
 Jesus talks about that your eye is a lamp that provides light for your body.
 And if your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light.
 Everybody goes, wow, if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.
 And so we're all reading this and we're going, oh my goodness, there is something so important
 about my eye that my whole entire body is going to follow this.
 So the question becomes, what is Jesus talking about?
 And he talks about a good eye versus a bad eye because clearly we want to be a people with a good
 eye.
 And so often here in the West, the way that we have understood this and interpreted and taught
 it is, you know, guard your eye gate, which is good wisdom.
 Don't look at things you shouldn't be looking at.
 Don't be searching your computer for things that you shouldn't be searching for.
 But if we could take a time machine back 2,000 years to the world of Jesus, they had Jewish
 idioms, sayings and phrases that if you're living in that day and time, you know exactly what
 everyone is talking about.
 We have our own here in the West.
 It takes one to no one.
 You can't teach it old dog, new tricks.
 What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
 You have to know what Vegas is to understand that idiom.
 They just had what happens in the capitalist, stays in the capitalist.
 That's exactly right.
 What happens with the Greeks, stays with the Greeks.
 Keep it Jewish people.
 So when Jesus is talking here in the sermon on the mound is a Jewish rabbi to a Jewish people
 when he raises the idea of a good eye, that's a Jewish idiom.
 Not only back in Jesus' day, but to this day in the land of Israel and to have a good eye
 means to be generous.
 To have a bad eye means to be stingy, to be tight, fisted.
 You say, "Christie, how in the world, culturally do we understand this?"
 If you look at the scriptures, the passage right before it is about money and the passage
 right after it is about money.
 Jesus is talking about money and our stewardship of it.
 So essentially he says the man who is generous, his whole body will be full of light and a man
 who's eye is bad or a stingy or tight fisted, his whole body will be full of darkness.
 And in the Middle East there's three cultural norms that govern the Middle East.
 Number one, they are in honor, shame, culture.
 Number two, as you've already mentioned, there are hospitality culture.
 The way you set a table of welcome, the way you open up your space for other says everything
 about you.
 And then third, they are a communal culture.
 The thing is in the plural.
 Everything is in the Wii.
 We're very individualistic as a Western, more Greco-Roman people.
 And so we're reading the sermon on the mount and we're like, "I want to be a person with
 a good eye.
 I want to be generous."
 And Proverbs chapter 11 verse 25 in our English Bible, it says, "A generous man will prosper
 himself, but in the original Hebrew it literally says, "A man with a good eye.
 A generous man will prosper."
 And he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.
 When I take teams to Israel, I get to actually see this lived out when we go onto the Mount
 of Olives.
 There's a professional beggar there.
 He's in his 80s.
 He always wears a sort of a black robe with a white hat.
 And when you walk by him, he will shake his cup and you'll hear him say, "Setaka,
 it's Hebrew for righteousness because one of the quintessential definitions of righteousness and
 Hebrew is generosity."
 And so we ask ourselves as a person, as a people, as a community, as business leaders, as leaders
 of nonprofits, whatever organizations are we fair or are we generous?
 Do we give everyone exactly what they pay for?
 Or do we refuse this culture of scarcity?
 And are we adamant to live in a world entered in sufficiency?
 I don't have to take from you for me to have enough.
 There's so much that I can give away and know that I will still be taken care of.
 I love the peace that we're not going to share here.
 You are going to teach it at the next level of leadership level.
 But there is a story that goes with this that just floors leaders and business owners.
 And I like it out white for that.
 But everything that you just talked about with that generous eye and the way that you look
 at people and you sum that up, I love that.
 Are we going to refuse this culture of scarcity?
 We live in this place.
 Rabbi Daniel Appen talks about this where people look, we're going to culture where people
 look at money and things and stuff as a pie.
 If somebody comes in and takes a big piece of pie, somebody has got a lot of money or they have
 a lot of stuff or a lot of whatever their business is bigger than mine, then they've actually
 taken away a bigger piece from the pie and I'm losing it.
 And he's like that is not how God's economy works.
 Instead it's more like the candle on top of a birthday cake.
 If I am lit, if I have a lit, if I'm lit, if I'm lit, if my candle is lit, if I'm
 lit, I can actually light years and I'm not losing.
 God's economy doesn't work in the same way our human brains can put it together.
 It's like, oh, one plus one equals two and God's like, no, one plus one can equal 4,000.
 That's just the way I choose to do this.
 And that concept of having a good eye.
 When you talk that piece here, I mean, it's just the room.
 I mean, it's just, woo, just this big sign, big response from people going, how do
 I make sure that I've got a good eye?
 And here, you know, like you said, here in a Western culture, we teach, hey, don't look at
 pornography.
 Yes, don't.
 Really, don't.
 Still look at the other.
 Still look at the other.
 This is really good direction here.
 But the concept of when I'm willing to be generous, you know, one of the things that we
 always teach is God doesn't ask you to give or to tie because he needs your money.
 He's got.
 He can make anything he wants to.
 He made a universe that's 93 billion light years across in Pico seconds.
 He can probably handle money.
 He needs it because he needs your heart to be in that place of giving and letting go.
 We think we own everything that we have.
 And we actually, you know, Solomon says, hey, go after everything, go build your empires,
 go get as much stuff as you want, go, you know, do whatever, but realize it's all in vain.
 Because at any moment, he could just thumb peel and go, hey, I want you to focus
 on me.
 So instead, when you have that good eye, and we got to, ah, okay, we'll lose it here.
 We got to experience this over and over and over again, majored who was our bus driver.
 The guy who owns the buses so God incredible man.
 The guy who owns all of the bus line, his guy couldn't be their coincidence.
 And so he actually took care of us for two weeks, you know, 12 days.
 He drove our buses around, which by the way, we don't know how to drive the stuff that he could
 do with the 55 passenger bus or 40 passenger bus, whatever once was just at site.
 It's phenomenal modern day miracle.
 It really is, but we would be in places and he's just driving down a road and all of a sudden
 just slams on the brakes.
 No, okay, maybe you didn't slam on the brakes, but pulls over, gets out, doesn't say anything.
 Runs into a store and then comes out with these treats or these things.
 He's like, hey, listen, this town, nobody does it like this town.
 Here is this Palestinian Muslim bus driver who is stepping on to the bus with a bunch of
 Christians going, hey, you need to try this.
 You need to experience, you're not going to get this anywhere else in our country.
 This is the place that does it right.
 And then we go somewhere else and he's doing something, there's, you know, the thing that he does,
 he constantly keeps giving one piece I can't share because you just have to experience it.
 But there's a point where his generosity, his hospitality just brought a bunch of us to tears.
 I mean, it was just the stunning moment where you're not expecting it and he's just taking care
 of things and he didn't think anything of it and it's just like, how come I've not experienced
 this.
 So having that good, I'm not going to ever forget Majad.
 I hope as we go back, if we could convince him, I'd love to have him again on our tours,
 but just so crazy, powerful.
 So some other things I wanted to kind of hit is the difference of how we look at the Bible and
 the way that they look at the Bible when they read the Bible.
 Here in a Western culture, especially nowadays, we've become so narcissistic in our Western
 culture lens that you're hearing a lot of preaching nowadays saying, read the Bible for what
 it says about you or what it tells you about you.
 That's not how they look at it.
 It's very different there.
 If I go put my Bible nerd hat on, you know, and tell my students all the time, we never
 read the Bible.
 We interact with it.
 We interact with the text when we are reading the scriptures, we're asking questions of it.
 What we don't often realize is the entire Bible was written by Middle Easterners and
 a Middle Eastern context.
 So here we are, thousands of years later, in Oshinaway, different culture, different time,
 different language.
 And when we read the Bible, we tend to ask Western questions of a Middle Eastern book.
 And so there's variances and differences when a Middle Eastern or touches the scriptures, when
 they eat them, when they read them, when they take them in, they ask different questions.
 So here we tend to read the Bible and say, what does this teach me about me?
 And I tell my students all the time, if you stare at yourself too long, you'll get depressed.
 The Bible was not given to you to stare at yourself.
 The Bible was given to us in the Middle East.
 They read the scriptures and their first question as always, what does this teach me about God?
 What does this show me about who he is?
 What he's like, what it looks like to walk with him.
 And it's a more buoyant posture, rather than going in and down in this internal thing.
 It lifts up our eyes.
 It creates a buoyancy in our spirits, in our hearts.
 And I tell my students all the time, if you want to figure you out stare at God because he created you.
 And as you get to know him, you will live into a better understanding of yourself.
 Yeah, I can tell you, it has been.
 And again, I've been doing this for decades.
 I've been studying God, the best of my ability and best of my understanding.
 Only to find out there's so much more as you always say, God's better.
 He's better than you think he is.
 I got to say that it has enhanced every aspect of my leadership.
 So already we've been teaching things that we've been teaching for decades on how to lead businesses
 and how to grow businesses and how to treat your people and the kind of culture that you're
 supposed to have, how to make strong decisions, all this stuff.
 One of the most powerful things for me on that trip over there as an individual, as a leader,
 is that, well, let me say, I grew up with the justice God.
 I grew up with just justice, period, right, right, wrong.
 They're an honor-shame society.
 We are a guilt society, a right wrong society.
 I have no problem seeing the justice side of God.
 And I think a ton of people here believe.
 They look at the Old Testament and they think, oh, no, this is a mean bad God and they are
 completely missing.
 Who's actually there, who's showing up?
 Because again, we don't understand the culture.
 It's the same thing as saying, you know, a thousand years from now, if somebody read, I drove to
 the store, they're going to be like, what exactly does that mean drove?
 What does that involve?
 Is that that car thing that they used to have?
 But, you know, it's a completely different context.
 And so understanding that has changed, God still very righteous and very, you know,
 justice is a huge piece for him.
 The love piece has, as I never forget, we came off with one of the trips you just liked
 me and said, that's just right your face, I didn't it.
 And I'm like, you could not have said it any better.
 And that became our saying for the next, you know, two weeks.
 The love of God and how much I have not even taught it correctly as somebody who has preached
 many sermons taught a lot, not understanding culturally, his love is so much greater than I've
 ever known than I could ever imagine.
 And being on that trip, it wasn't just once.
 It wasn't twice.
 Sometimes it was a barrage of, do you see how much I love you?
 Do you see how I love you here?
 Do you see how I love my kids?
 Do you see why I did this?
 Do you see this?
 And it became so powerful for me as a leader coming back and realizing my responsibility.
 I mean, I teach the responsibility of your team is your responsibility, your family.
 But helping them to see even further his love has been so important.
 And I think for my team, watching my team grow over the last couple of months and just that
 love factor, it is enhanced all of their walks.
 The Bible is the story of God pursuing the lost, not to judge them, be them, smite them, or
 kill them, but to rescue them, to save them, to renew them, and to restore them.
 One of the most famous examples talking about reading the Bible for what does it teach me
 about me versus what does it teach me about God?
 When we come to Luke 15, Jesus gives these stories, these parables.
 And one of them is very famous to us here in the West.
 We call it the parable of the prodigal son because we read the Bible and ask what does it teach
 me about me.
 But in the Middle East, they call that story the parable of the running father because it's
 all about a father who ran to a tone for his lost son and to bring him back into the house.
 And this is the good news that all of us are lost and all of us are in need of a shepherd,
 and God has come down into dust and ruin, not to destroy, but to save.
 And the story of the Bible is about God doing his work.
 It's very interesting when he comes to Abraham in Genesis 12 to enter into a covenant with
 him.
 Every time he says, "I will, I will, I will," he never says, "You will."
 It's all about who God is and what he is doing.
 It's part of what I mean when I say that I want to Israel and learn that God is
 better than I ever knew and it's really allowed me to try to mature out of the orphan that sometimes
 is in my spirit that scranges, that strives and strains as if it were all up to me.
 And to really try to live into my son's ship or my daughter's ship that I have a high and
 holy father who has pulled up a chair at his table of sufficiency of eternal shalom, holding
 this flourishing and delight and he invites me to that table just as I am because the work of restoration
 in my life is his.
 And as I take my seat at the table, he will do it.
 He is doing it and he's going to do it until it's done.
 To not go into too much because guys, we're going to actually talk about an opportunity because
 we're going back.
 That's why we're going to talk about that in just a second.
 So it's so difficult not to give away some of the most phenomenal pieces, but speaking on that as we talk
 through like the prodigal son and a lot of people don't realize and they may have heard it
 preach before that really what he was saying by saying I want my inheritance.
 Is he saying I wish you were dead because nobody in a Middle Eastern culture would have done
 that except to say I wish your dead so I can inherit because that's the only way we inherit.
 The interesting thing is when he returns back to the father, he's actually not returning to the father
 as much as he's returning to be a slave.
 At least I could be a slave and it's a very dangerous thing to do because in that culture he's already said
 I want my father dead.
 And so the father running out to him is that representation of no matter how jacked up you get in life,
 no matter how bad your decisions are, no matter how low you get and you think that you're going to return to me and
 just go, okay Lord, I am just a piece of crap.
 Will you at least let me be a slave.
 God rushes out and pursues the child who's made the bad decisions who screwed up,
 who's got themselves in a bad place.
 The whole time and it's not just that one parable, there's so many different elements that you just got to come and learn it
 where God is running and pursuing after us.
 And then as you say restoring us to a place, we didn't even expect to get to.
 We weren't even hoping to get to.
 We were just thinking, I don't have to eat after these pigs.
 Maybe I can just go be slave.
 That pursuit of God shows up in my whole life.
 There's not a place.
 There's not a time that he has not been pursuing me.
 I feel like I've got a pretty fantastic relationship with God.
 I feel like I am growing immensely and just consuming him so much of him and his love and all the stuff.
 And yet he still does not stop pursuing.
 It's not like he's okay.
 Well, Chris, you're good. I'm going to go look after something.
 He's the guy who spread billions of galaxies in Pico seconds.
 He can handle me and everybody else on the planet at the same time and continue to pursue me.
 So I think for me that has just been the most amazing love story.
 Is that I keep thinking it's about me.
 I keep thinking I have to do all the right things.
 I keep thinking I have to be, you know, I've got to impress the God of the universe, which is hilarious.
 And the whole time he's like, son, I'm coming after you every second with all of me.
 All I ask is give me you.
 Seek me.
 So what are some last things you want to help leaders, business owners, team members to just kind of know before we wrap this up?
 You know, I think just as a leader, it's important to embrace the disruption to look for things that will take you out of your normalcy.
 Things that get you out of your average patterns and ways of doing things.
 It's a pathway for new learning, whatever that's going to be.
 If Israel is something that some people out there want to experience, it's certainly a table that we want to set for them.
 You can never unsee what you've seen.
 And it's interesting, you know, people ask me often, Christy, do you take non-Christians people that don't profess a faith in God or who don't go to church?
 Will you take them to Israel?
 And that question is funny to me.
 Everyone is welcome at the table.
 Everyone is welcome at God's table.
 And everyone is welcome at our table for Israel.
 God doesn't stop pursuing.
 It's right.
 It just doesn't stop pursuing our folks.
 Here's the thing.
 We kind of talked about the set our retreat.
 Our next level of astral my retreat because we're just planning one trip and thinking, you know, hey, we'll share this.
 We'll share it with the folks that listen to the podcast.
 We're going to share it again at the next level leadership live event and go into a much bigger deeper teaching time on that as well.
 It's part of all of the leadership lessons that we're doing.
 And we hope that up and come to find out, wow, a lot of people wanted to go.
 So here's what we are doing.
 We are going to be doing two trips.
 We are going to be opening this thing up for people.
 The first one is going to be in the fall of 2020.
 The second one is going to be in the spring of 2021.
 Now, you might be thinking, well, that's a long ways off.
 Yep, get it on your count.
 It's start doing the things I teach you to do.
 Get it prepared.
 Play in for this sucker so that you could come and join us over there and have a life-changing trip.
 You've got time to do this, but we have created a wait list.
 So what we want you to do, because we don't even have the details yet on the spring event, what we want you to do is go to
 Chrissacrote.com/Israel.
 Chrissacrote.com/Israel and put your information in there.
 And as people put their information in, we will load them up onto the wait list.
 And as we are able to get the dates and get everything in place, then we will start to let you guys know.
 What I have told all of my clients.
 So as I've come back, because our whole leadership team went, we didn't go as a leadership team.
 We just went together.
 And it was crazy power.
 We've got some leadership teams in the next level.
 Mastermind, now taking their leadership team on the next trip.
 And it was just phenomenal as a team.
 But as we came back, people are like, explain it to me.
 And it's like, "Yeah, you just can't do it. You just can't explain it all."
 But one of the things I keep saying over and over again, if I ever suggest any vacation or anything over this, punch me in the throat.
 That's awesome.
 Because this is the most life-changing trip you will ever have.
 So Chrissacrote.com/Israel.com/Israel.
 Go put your information in.
 If you want to do this, then we will put you on a wait list.
 And as we get the details, which hopefully will be in a few months, then we will launch that and share that.
 And we will take a bunch of you guys over there and have a huge impact on your life.
 A great author, Loast Verberg.
 I love one of the things she talks about.
 She talks about unpacking your suitcase coming back from Israel.
 She's like the dust from Masada and the shells that you pick up and the things that you're not supposed to bring back.
 You actually do. You see these elements like the rocks from when we're standing where David stood when he took down Goliath.
 When you pull these things out, unpacking your suitcase takes moments, unpacking your memories takes years.
 And that is so absolutely true, just crazy powerful trip.
 So thanks again, Chrissie, for being here and being on the show.
 I really appreciate you coming in and doing this.
 Thanks for having me. I can't wait to behold in the land of the Bible with you.
 Amen. Amen. Folks, Chrissie is going to be speaking at the next level of leadership live event on biblical truths and leadership,
 and seeing the Bible through the Middle Eastern lens, which will absolutely wreck your face off of telling you it is changed my life.
 It's changed my leadership. It's changed my team.
 It's changing everything that we're doing here.
 So do not miss that. Get your tickets to that event.
 Get your tickets to that event. Get that today.
 And one last thing, how can people get more of you? Fantastic.
 They can go visit new lens, biblical studies.com.
 They can find out all the information for the trips for local series upcoming events, different things.
 All that fun stuff, fantastic.
 Folks, as always, take this information, change your leadership, change your business, change your life.
 Just do it. Make that decision right now. Change your life.
 And join us on the next episode.
