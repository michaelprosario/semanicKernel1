 Welcome to the Chris LaCardau Show, where we discuss leadership and life and discover that
 business is what you do not who you are.
 [Music]
 Welcome to the show folks. Hope you're having a fabulous day wherever you are. We are having
 such a great day. We have on the show today we have got the fabulous, the amazing, the beautiful
 brine Alex, Brian, welcome to the show. That is me and I'm happy to be here.
 And we also have the, outlandish, the exuberant, I don't know, I'm out of about about you to
 read the bio-crest, just read the bio. That's what we're going to do.
 Brian, don't let Brian ever give you the bio.
 Oh, we have got a fun show. In fact, we've got a Brian, what do we call it a series?
 Yeah, mini series, a mini. A mini series.
 That we are doing, that we are excited about. We think you guys are going to love.
 But before we get into that, tell everybody what we're doing, Brian.
 Yeah, so we're talking in this particular episode about successful delegation.
 And this is obviously for productivity as leaders, but also, you know, so that our teams are empowered
 with whatever, you know, we're tasking them with without sacrificing our sanity.
 And we're going to get into that in a second to talk about why so many leaders are hesitant
 to delegate. Why is this such an issue as a leadership concept?
 But just to talk about the little series that we're doing, we've never done something like this before.
 So hopefully this comes off.
 Like we want it to, which is fun and kind of rapid fire.
 So it's really good in our minds.
 In theory, it's amazing. In theory.
 So the idea here, we're going to set this up.
 We'll go to break, we'll come back. And we're going to talk about three rules for successful delegation.
 The caveat here is that I've not talked about these rules with Chris or with Joel.
 I have no idea. They're going to like it. They're going to hate it.
 They're going to want to chop it up and reconfigure it, put their own words.
 I don't know. Anything, no holds barred, anything could go.
 So we're going to have some fun talking about these rules.
 At the end of the show, hopefully we'll have some clarity on what those rules should be.
 But all along the way for the listeners, they're going to get to see the ideation and the thought process that goes into this.
 So while this isn't so much teaching, they're going to be learning about how we arrive at a certain conclusion about the topic we're dealing with.
 I like it. And if I understand myself what you were saying at the beginning of that is that sacrificing your sanity is a bad thing.
 If you have any left, then yes, getting rid of it is a problem. Keep that the problem.
 All right. Well, we come back after this. We're going to tackle Brian's three rules of delegation.
 Hey, it's Joel Fortner here. I'm the Vice President of Leadership Development on Chris's team.
 And I oversee our next level mastermind business coaching program.
 Most business owners and leaders lack a clear path to succeed in business.
 The question whether they're making the right decisions, if they're focusing on the right things to really grow their business.
 If this is you, you need to coach in your life.
 Coaches help you make better decisions, navigate uncertainty, lead more effectively, and grow your business without sacrificing your life in your family.
 In their first year, our clients typically see an average of 67% increase in gross revenue and an average of 138% increase in net profit and regain hours of time.
 Our clients stay in the program for 3.5 years simply because of the results they get.
 So if you're ready to run your business at the next level and see the growth you've been wanting, then visit ChrisCarto.com/mastermind.
 Again, ChrisCarto.com/mastermind today.
 Alright, we're back and Brian, all right, you take it from here brother.
 That is what I like to do. So Harbor, Harbor Business Review.
 Harvard Business Review says this, one of the most difficult transitions for leaders to make is the shift from doing to leading.
 And we all know we've all been there. I mean Chris, this was a startup at some point.
 Now it's the megalithic, you know, point main group, shepherding shepherds all across the world across the land, cross the globe, whatever.
 But we were, we've all been there and we're there a lot of times where it's easier to do sometimes than to teach how to do and to successfully delegate that to other people.
 So let's just deal with this really quickly at the beginning. So it sets up the context. Why is it so tough for leaders to delegate?
 Yeah, this is something that we hit really hard in killing the leadership crazy cycle.
 And if you just listen to the title killing the leadership crazy cycle, there's a reason we call it the leadership crazy cycle because you end up in this process where you keep thinking you're accomplishing a lot.
 And you are, you're doing the whole ton of tasks that day you're overwhelmed.
 You know, you get home and your spouse says, what you do today, like I really don't have a clue. It was so much.
 And it seems like things are happening, but unfortunately there's no duplication on the process. Why is it so tough to delegate?
 The number one reason for me is that I don't trust that the person I first off, I don't understand how to delegate properly.
 So it was just assumed that everything is under the concept of, I don't know what proper delegation looks like.
 So what's talking about for you personally here, I mean, is this behind the scenes?
 I just think so much sense. It makes sense now.
 I don't know. I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 I just think so much sense now.
 It does have to give me more work to do.
 It does have trust me.
 But yeah, I really don't know what I'm talking about.
 I just, we just for some reason people show up and listen to the show.
 The, the, the reason why delegation is so tough
 is because when I don't know how to properly delegate when I don't, and we've all experienced it,
 we've all had leaders in the past.
 I went to delegate something to us and then they didn't lead us well.
 They didn't instruct us well.
 We didn't do it the same way they did and then after three attempts,
 you know, of them coming by going, did you do it?
 Did you do it?
 Did you do it?
 Did you do it?
 And we've not really got to admit the way that they wanted to be, they take it back.
 And that's how we've experienced delegation, right?
 It happens everywhere across the globe.
 This mega-lithic company,
 I'm, I'm gonna use that.
 I'm just a lot of got to put that in there.
 We have taught so many leaders how to
 not be afraid to not be afraid by understanding what proper delegation is.
 So without knowing what it is, delegation is so tough because I don't trust that the first someone
 gives something to, is going to get it done.
 I don't trust that they're going to do it the way that I would have it done.
 I don't trust that if I do delegate it, that my life is going to get easier
 than my ability to lead. I'm going to move on to something else.
 And I'm going to have to come back and take, you know,
 I'm going to put more on my plate because I just took something off my plate.
 Then I'm going to have to grab that packet, put it back on my plate,
 and my plate is over full yet again.
 And then another really super tough part is that if my identity is wrapped up in the various things that I'm trying to delegate,
 then man, it's going to be really difficult for me to get that off my plate.
 Because the moment I do, I can't see beyond it. And so my fear is,
 well, I won't actually be needed anymore, which is just the world's biggest lie,
 because at any leader who has ever delegated properly understands, you become more valuable once that's off of your plate.
 So those are my pieces, Joseph.
 And by the way, people as that's what,
 did you just call him Joseph? No, Joel Seth, it's just a nickname.
 So actually, he's a name changer, he's a name changer.
 I'm a name changer, that's right.
 So other pieces, so first of all, I think Chris and I,
 almost speak for you, Chris, we would both agree Brian with that rule,
 or with that Harvard business review.
 Yes, and so Paul. Harvard's principle is sound.
 We should have a little ding.
 We can have an air and add that in when you go to the publisher stuff a little and add that in.
 We haven't got to the rules yet.
 We're just saying, I don't know.
 Oh, no. That was a rule.
 Never mind. See this is Iniating.
 I like this because people are seeing how the sausage is made here on podcast land.
 This is somebody's reaction.
 This is what you meant by ideation. How do we actually do stuff?
 It's always so pretty.
 Just like jokes.
 There's other things involved.
 There's fears involved.
 Where your worth is coming from.
 It holds you back for making that transition.
 There's the I stink it communicating.
 So I don't trust myself to even delegate it well because you're not going to understand it.
 And I don't have the words for it.
 I have conversations with people all the time.
 Or the time to communicate it.
 Oh, I can't do that.
 I can't properly delegate it.
 Or I've done that before and it didn't work out well.
 So let me just keep on doing that.
 Never thinking.
 When is that going to end?
 Because I also want to grow this company or grow my team.
 So you've got contradictory thought there.
 Yep.
 All right.
 Good. Well, we've dug quite a hole.
 So let's slowly help people climb out of this hole that we've dug them in.
 So here's how we play.
 I'm going to read a rule and it's associated rationale.
 And then one of you will kick it off within immediate gut reaction.
 Again, maybe you love it, maybe you hate it.
 But you'll need to modify it to fit your perspective and experience.
 Then the other person weighs in either agreeing or disagree.
 Hopefully more disagreement because that's going to be more entertaining and more informative.
 And then at that point the listener hopefully is going to take away from all this
 deliberation that goes into everything.
 A greater perspective.
 Okay. So.
 I'm going to put it in a game show.
 I know. That's fun.
 We can get you to use the most unique UVC Harvey.
 We need air and to put in little buzzers.
 At the right time.
 Okay.
 So here we go.
 Three rules for successful delegation.
 We'll do the first two.
 We'll take a break.
 Do the third one.
 You must be an expert in the task you wish to delegate.
 Here's the rationale.
 And then I'll read the rule one more time.
 If you have any doubt or ambiguity about the task you're delegating,
 you will inevitably transfer that doubt and ambiguity to the person you're delegating it to.
 And they will never accomplish it.
 So you must be an expert in the task you want to delegate.
 Go.
 I'm going to agree 75%.
 I do not agree.
 Just focus on the 25% and push it.
 So here's the pushback.
 So the obvious answer is yes you should be an expert.
 However.
 That is a rule built in a vacuum.
 Right?
 It's the assumption that if you're not an expert,
 you're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You're not a expert.
 You just need to let me do the thing that you're delegating in my way.
 No, no, no, no.
 If it is successful, otherwise it shouldn't be delegating in.
 Then I want you to do most of what I've accomplished.
 Let's work together to see what you come up with.
 That's better on your end.
 Or fit your personality style better.
 I can't example this.
 If I'm delegating to a high sea, something I've been doing,
 there's no possible way of high sea.
 I'm talking 80, 90s.
 You know, there's no way they're going to do it the same way.
 I work.
 I can do things without having an immense amount of detail built around it.
 I don't even have to see the whole picture.
 I need to see most of it.
 But I need to just understand what is this thing.
 What are we doing?
 What's the purpose?
 And then I can go make the thing happen.
 High sea is going to need way more details.
 Way higher view.
 So that they can then, then you the 30,000 foot view so that they can understand the five foot implementation.
 So if I'm an expert to my abilities, then sure, I'm an expert.
 But if I am delegating something that I know exactly how this is supposed to be,
 it's leaving out you bringing anything to the table.
 It's leaving out perspective.
 It's definitely leaving out ownership.
 It's leaving out buy-in.
 One of the big things we teach all the time around here is that you don't just go dictate to somebody what they're going to do.
 Help them to have buy-in and ownership by giving them dignity of speaking into the situation.
 You know, here, teach, teach, teach, what do you see?
 What do you think?
 What's your input?
 Teach, teach, teach.
 What do you see?
 What do you think?
 What's your input?
 How could you make this better?
 All of those things allows the person you're delegating to to have some dignity in the process which gives them buy-in and ownership.
 So I would say in the rapid fire answer, 75% I agree with that, but I would agree with that 100% in a vacuum, 75% in real-world.
 Joseph.
 Yeah, I, you know, unfortunately I can't disagree.
 Sorry, Brian.
 Because you had one job, one job, one job, and I failed.
 So yeah, when you take the, the reason I agree in I align with what Chris is saying is because it's about what's the end goal of delegation.
 It is properly setting somebody up for success.
 That doesn't mean you have to have all the information.
 It's can you lead them to be successful in what you're delegating to so that maybe here's all my information.
 Here's the process.
 Here's what I've done.
 That's as far as I can go and then the person starts to ask questions.
 What about this?
 What about that?
 What about this?
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 Those are all great questions.
 Can you go get information on that?
 And let's actually on that piece.
 Let's discuss it and talk about it before you move forward.
 And then they do that.
 And then you sit down and then you have more discussion.
 And now they're set up for success.
 Did you have to be an expert for that person to be set up for success?
 No.
 Because it's a relationship.
 It's dual sided.
 So as a leader, you're looking at, I need to delegate this because I need to get it off my plate.
 I need to move on to other things.
 I've hired somebody who's smarter than me.
 I've, you know, expanding the company, expanding the team.
 And I'm adding team members.
 So let's get this stuff off the plate.
 And so now it's a, you've got someone smart and capable.
 Hopefully you've done a great job in your hiring process.
 Bringing someone on with great capacity and potential to be taught.
 And now it's focusing on making them successful.
 Well, if you're trying to do a task or a project or some initiative and you've done it for five years.
 And you've taken it so far and then you've realized,
 I need somebody who can do this all the time because I can only spend three hours a week on it.
 But this is critical to get to the vision that we want to get to execute the strategy.
 We want to execute.
 So now let's bring somebody on who's been doing this for 15 years and can do it for 40 to 50 hours a week.
 And so it's, you can see all this and see where you don't have to be an expert to set somebody up for success to do the job well.
 Yeah, if this was a political debate, I would give it 30 second or buttole, right?
 Is that correct?
 This is about to say that, I was about to say that the delegate from Idaho will yield the mic.
 I did something to things right there.
 My go ahead.
 You'll point it out something super important.
 If you do not hire people smarter than you, then yes, you need to be the expert.
 If you hire people smarter than you, then no, there is a level of trusting that they can do this.
 Hopefully, you know, I looked to bring people on that are going to do things better than I can.
 So that I don't, you know, it can go to a whole not a level.
 Yeah, I'm glad we're doing this rapid fire because if this wasn't it'd be like a three hour episode.
 Okay, moving on delegate will yield the mic now the delegate.
 I see what I, I see what I, I see what I'm explaining it.
 Forget it.
 Okay, real number two, you okay.
 Here we go.
 Is that the expectation for accountability must be clearly set.
 All right, the rationale.
 The delegate must understand what is expected as far as outcome and when it is expected by and that's why we employ tools like KRAs and KPIs.
 So again, here's the role expectation for accountability must be clearly set.
 Joseph, yeah uncomfortable pause.
 I can't, I can't think of anything right now that I would disagree with on that rule,
 especially from a leadership perspective on if I'm understanding the rule correctly,
 because otherwise I'm not setting up who I'm leading for success.
 They don't have clarity on the expectation.
 They don't have a clarity on what even accountability is around the expectation.
 About this is how this is going to go. This is why I'm going to all this detail.
 This is why I'm leading you to see what winning and success looks like in your job.
 This is how you get there.
 Here's what we're going to measure.
 Here's how we're going to meet.
 This is when we're going to discuss stuff.
 Here's what I'm going to hold you accountable to.
 You know, this is what if we don't achieve these things.
 This is what happens.
 I want you to see the ripple effect of that across the team or the company.
 It's just it goes back to having high levels of quality communication.
 Because it's the number one thing that causes failure mistakes in problems within.
 Basically, every company on the planet is so many issues come back to a lack of this kind of a rule.
 Yeah, Joel just put it up. A number one thing that we see with every single business we work with.
 The number one issue is a lack of high levels of quality communication.
 Number two is right up there with it.
 A lack of quality accountability.
 Accountability is making sure that somebody is set up for success.
 Somebody has training.
 Somebody has the tools.
 Somebody understands what they're doing. Somebody's been able to ask every question that they have to make sure that there's no confusion.
 Everything's been communicated incredibly well.
 Things are put in place to metrics to measure how well is this going.
 How's it doing all this again?
 Like a point back to killing the leadership crazy cycle.
 There's this process of delegation that is a it's not a short process.
 It's a long process of you making sure you've done all the right things on the front side.
 And then you're coming along and helping guiding answering questions, letting some rope out.
 When they're at a place where they can run with it on their own, then you let out considerably more rope all through that process.
 Accountability isn't what we believe it is.
 Did you do this? Did you do this? Did you get that done yet? Is it done yet?
 It's not done yet? All right. Let me take it back.
 That is not accountability. Accountability is making somebody successful by putting all the right pieces in place for them to do that.
 And then you're going to have to do that.

 Yeah, I mean, come on, man.
 We need to harder one that.
 We need to tough the road.
 We need something we can battle.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Here's the funny thing.
 As you say it, the rule 100%.
 There's no sense or buts about it.
 If you do not give all of the things, the person needs to be successful.
 Frustration is going to happen.
 Here's the funny thing.
 As you were reading that rule off, I thought of every leader.
 And every entrepreneur that heard,
 oh, that's so much.
 Oh, I don't have time for that.
 So funny thing is the rule is easy.
 Yep, absolutely 100%.
 Here's where the struggle comes in.
 So many leaders do not.
 And this is a part of not delegating properly.
 So many leaders do not believe they have the time to spend on getting all the very things you just listed off.
 And that is huge.
 That becomes a net.
 And here's the funny thing is they also don't see
 how them not spending the time getting the right tools or it's off or the right education.
 What if the training whatever it is, how it comes back to their frustration?
 They may not even be really as concerned about the frustration of the team.
 Remember because they may be thinking about this and by fire,
 hey, figure this thing out and they'll make it happen.
 What they don't see is that this is going to come back and frustrate the daylights out of them as a leader
 because they didn't do their job right.
 They didn't get all the things in place.
 They didn't take care of the team member.
 They didn't get the right tools.
 They didn't even stop.
 I remember years ago, years ago,
 another leader hired a team member and didn't have a computer.
 An email.
 No saw nothing.
 The person should, I don't even think they had a phone.
 The person showed up and there was a desk and that was literally it.
 And they started that day going, oh, oh, we should have gotten you this.
 I was just this colossal failure of setting up a team member who showed up in for days because it took days to get a computer,
 all the software, all the things ready for that person actually do any work.
 So yes, I completely agree.
 I'm trying to think of something to disagree with.
 I mean, I'm just going to find something.
 I'm just going to film what I've gotten to find like a little tiny piece and take it out of context and disagree.
 So well, go ahead.
 I think there is a way to do that.
 And I think I have an idea of it.
 Shoot.
 Yeah.
 The only way that I see right now.
 And I'm only only so smart.
 So there's probably lots of other ways.
 Is going to what we've talked about already.
 Is the pretty much go back and listen everything we already said.
 It's like, it's like, does the person need all the information to do better, better, better in the job or in the task you delegated? Yes.
 But again, is it all on the leader to pass on all that information?
 No.
 Because again, that's in a vacuum.
 It's not you're not hiring someone that doesn't have a brain.
 You're an up or shifting somebody into a role on your team that doesn't have a brain.
 And it's like, I literally have no idea.
 Let's go back to school on what a computer is.
 And now let me work you up to be successful from there.
 And so like that's the like that and that's the only thing is that to the point.
 It's the criticality of making the time because that time of
 Jection comes up all the time.
 That's the thing that holds people back.
 It's like even when people are considering coming and working with us and thinking about doing coaching.
 And then it's presented with all of this change.
 You have to be ready to change if you're ever going to even consider doing coaching.
 It's usually a good sign when someone pops in as like, "Hey, Joel or Aaron, I'm interested in doing a coaching program."
 And then we start to really walk through that conversation and we get to the, what do you think about doing this?
 Oh, man, it sounds like a lot of time.
 Yep.
 And so it's a longer conversation that I'm going to have with somebody.
 But the short answer right now on this podcast is that's exactly why you need to be doing this program.
 Because that's your objection.
 Time is not the issue.
 It's how we're making decisions as the lack of having good systems.
 In rituals and habits daily, weekly, monthly to prioritize, manage your time, manage your tasks.
 And that's where we have to solve that.
 Hence once again, how this has become the killing leadership crazy cycle episode.
 We've got to solve that if we're actually going to achieve the goals that you really want to achieve,
 which is to continue to grow your company, to grow your team, add a new product, add a new service, operate with excellence,
 take better care of your customers, or whatever are solve the problems you're living with today.
 We've got to get past this time objection, which is more, it's just a personal problem more than anything else,
 because we have that learned or you're not yet implementing really great systems and processes to solve that problem.
 Yeah, and if I can use my 30 second repo, again something that Joe pointed out,
 when you think about it, if you have, let's just look at personality styles,
 Brian, your personality style, your super task oriented in so many ways, right?
 There are things that you've brought to the table that immediately, because for me,
 we have 14 but Jillian subscriptions and software things that we use, I'm always like no more, nothing new, nothing new,
 but it's useless stuff that we have, and the reason why is because people can go, oh, this new thing,
 and then it doesn't get used. Oh, this, we got this amazing new things that we got to use it,
 no, it doesn't get used, it's a waste time money energy, right?
 But there have been things that you've brought to the table that you're like, hey, this is so much easier to do it this way,
 this is a better process, this is more efficient for us. And so as you've brought that to the table,
 it's taken me getting out of, you know, owner CEO, not super task focused role and going,
 is it benefiting the team? Is that better for what we're accomplishing? Even if I don't use it,
 because again, there's a lot of stuff that I don't use in my role, because I shouldn't be doing it,
 my focus is on leading people, teams, events, all that kind of stuff.
 And because you've brought those to the table, and we've taken a hard look at it, I went, yep, that's smarter,
 that's a better way. So along with what Joel was saying is, yes,
 you've got to give the tools, however, if you're hiring people that are smarter than you,
 they may be able to bring things to the table that you go, oh, well, that would be way better and easier than the way that I've been doing.
 All right, well, I have zero rebuttal with all that fight praise. I will, saying yes on the hypercent.
 We just hit the background, have any rebuttal. That is fat, okay.
 Fat, that's not her first name, Jane is, but anyway, she's just monitoring me as I do this.
 She's, she's a little fluffy today. Follow her feeding. I follow her.
 You can't, I know that. I love my cats and I try not to overfeed them. Okay, we are done.
 That's a wrap. And I hope you enjoyed this. I'm going to let Chris use his, his one liner that we close out the show with,
 but we will have a couple more of these three rules to something, something, something coming up.
