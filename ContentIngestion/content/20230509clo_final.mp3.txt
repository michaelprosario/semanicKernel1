 What is a grant? Why would I want one and how can I get it? All of that is up next with a leadership coach Justin Lair
 Welcome to the Chris LaCardo Show where we discuss leadership and life and
 Discover that business is what you do not who you are
 Welcome to the show folks. I hope you're having a fabulous day wherever you are
 Today we are talking about small business grants. That's the the theme of the show today
 And I'm excited to get into this since it's something we haven't ever really talked about and at least not in any depth
 In any long while so let me kind of define what we're talking about today
 What is a grant? What are they?
 And then I'm gonna introduce our guest who is gonna help us to dig down deeper
 So a small business grant is a some of money usually water to a small business is a form of financial aid
 And all these grants are word by government agencies as well as non-profit organizations and they're designed to help small businesses grow
 Now that may be offered for a variety purposes such as initial startup cause or
 Research and development or marketing expenses or expansion and
 Additionally some grants may even be targeted specifically at businesses that are owned by women or minority groups now
 It's important to note that small business grants are not loans and therefore do not need to be repaid
 However, they often come with specific conditions and requirements such as the need to use the funds for
 Specific purpose or to report on the progress of the project and at this point I'm assuming all of that is clear
 It's my well well, well, I've invited an expert on the show today to help us sort through this information
 In its our very own Justin layer who is a leadership coach here at the plumbing group
 So welcome to the show Justin good to have you on
 Thanks Chris. It's the excited to be here. I appreciate it. I know we have got a lot of stuff to hit
 We've got a lot of facts that we've got to get out there for people to understand and I am assuming right now
 There is a decent number of people with
 You know some objections to this whole idea
 So I want to kind of hit all of these aspects and just leave it out there for people to decide
 But before we do that how about you introduce yourself?
 Give your background, you know work experience all that stuff including
 Obviously you're current role with us right so I am
 When I self-proclaimed serial entrepreneur I've been doing business my whole life
 I started my first business when I was 15 years old
 I did have a stint in the Marine Corps after high school that
 Essentially ended that first business for me and then after the Marine Corps
 I just jumped right back into business
 I've started nine businesses throughout my life at this point
 I currently own a couple of businesses as well as my role here with the plumbing group as a leadership coach
 I take care of the kale pee program here and
 My experience with grants started a couple of years back
 I was I was involved in running a local nonprofit for that helped entrepreneurs build their businesses here in our local community and
 Being in the nonprofit you're just in the grants space and I learned so much about grants and
 I realized that there was as a small business owner for like my whole life
 I knew nothing about this and
 We I think we've all seen that information on the middle of the night. I'm not sure if I don't watch TV anymore
 I don't know if it's still plays or not, but there was a guy that running around in this purple suit
 I think if I recall correctly the head question marks all over it and he was like selling this book that could get you all these grants
 I think I remember him saying there's like trillions of dollars of free grant money gone to waste every year that you could go get and
 And so that was always in my mind and my wife as well
 She was when it pushed me she's like, you know, you need to go get a grant. There's this free money out there and you're just missing out and
 So of course being a great husband that I tried to be
 I was like, okay, I'll go entertain my wife and and look into this grant stuff and so I entered the world of grants
 And it was I learned so much and I will sometimes here entrepreneurs talking about the
 desire to pursue grants and
 There's so much I want to tell them of like
 I realized most entrepreneurs don't even really know what they're asking for and well
 Yeah, there's also so many bad stigmas
 with grants and just you know, oh, you're just taking our tax money and yadiyada
 Yada, so I think there's probably you know one not understanding what grants are but also
 Like as we go through this morning how many people are going?
 But I would never do something like that right? Did you experience that from time to time with people?
 Yeah a little bit more so it's like, oh, I'm gonna go get the free money
 It's great. A lot of people try to find that park right right
 But I do here that some folks don't want anything to do with grants because they you know
 They figure it's government money and they just don't want anything to with the government
 They don't want to get tied in with that either and that's unfortunate as well
 Because there's some great grant opportunities out there that people can't take advantage of for good reason
 Yeah, I could totally see that there are some folks that are just excited about free money and
 You know, which if that's your major focus
 You probably don't have a great business idea to start with anyways, but I could see that a lot of folks are are probably stuck on that
 All right, so as we get into this let's start with
 The most important question what is a grant?
 You know, is it is it actually just free money is it?
 You know, why don't we hear more about this stuff and
 You know, do we have to pay them back or the things that we should avoid all that kind of fun information?
 Yeah, so what I would like to do is kind of paint a picture of what a grant is
 And in this analogy, I think we'll just get everybody
 You know, answer a lot of questions. It get everybody's mind wrapped around this thing
 So if we just think about the government
 Is it giant entity has so many you know arms of of
 Operation and so much stuff going on?
 So let's just say there's a problem in the world or in our country that the government is interested in in finding a resolution to or solving it or preventing it
 So because I live in a beset of northwest we deal with a really horrible fire season every year
 So I'm going to use that as an example. So let's say the government realizes that the damages that wildfires are causing and the
 Emergencies and all this stuff in the Pacific Northwest are a problem and it's costing a lot of money and putting a lot of people through a lot of
 Trouble and so they want to do something to help prevent forest fires
 So they have a couple options they could
 Develop their own forest fire
 Arm of the government and they could get the employees in place and get all the resources in place and build a strategy and almost you know
 Build a business right in figuring out how to solve this wildfire problem and
 Kind of start from scratch they could do that and we know the government's great
 It solved the problems themselves right and so but the amount of money and time that it would take for them to kind of start this thing up from scratch
 Is something to think about so the other thing they could do is use
 Organizations out there in the world that already exists and already have the professionals in place
 They have the tools in place that that have the knowledge to be able to begin to tackle a problem like this
 They could use
 There thing that's already in place and created then they could fund that
 By way of grant and say hey if there's any organization out there that has a desire to
 Figure out a way that we could prevent forest fires
 That we could then use to help us solve this problem then we will give you money
 To tackle it so they'll create a thing called an RFP a request for proposal
 Saying hey if you have a project proposal out there
 We in your organization that you would love to do but you just don't have the resources to fully tackle it right now
 We would love to hear your proposal and
 If it makes sense if it fits our criteria and we feel like we will be able to get something out of it
 The government will be able to get something out of it
 Then we are willing to pay you to go do it
 That's really what a grant is and so in this case the government will
 You know choose one organization or choose multiple organizations to be able to go do the thing
 But they need to be able to make sure they get something out of it that their money. It's not technically free money. It's
 They're gonna hire you basically by giving you this grant money to accomplish this project
 The project before you get the grant is gonna it needs to be very detailed and and you know
 There's a time frame and there's a you know this is what we're going to accomplish and this what we're going to use the money for
 And it has to sit inside the box that they've created and then they will give you the money to go do it
 You know and I think so many folks now
 Obviously are there
 Ridiculous grants out there totally there are there some grants out there and money is you know
 There's definitely some things that have been pushed through and you know that have
 We would probably disagree with no money should not go to
 Measuring the flow of catch up. Yes, that there's definitely some ridiculous stuff out there
 But what you're talking about for the average
 Business owner who has a product that can help people a product that can solve things is that there are opportunities out there that the government is saying
 We're gonna pour money into this one way or another
 We're gonna try and solve this on our own or we can find people who are way better at it than the government is
 Who have already been pushing in that direction and and fund them to make this something
 That is
 More widely available is that would that be decently accurate?
 Absolutely absolutely
 So in that again, you know, it is funny to see the dude who used to run around it so if I took me a second to remember that commercial as you were bringing that up
 But it is funny to see the dude who's running around in the the question mark suit
 Talking about all the amazing grants the truth is what are you saying is accurate those exist out there
 Somebody is going to get it
 The question is is it going to be something that helps
 Business to solve a
 Problem that the government sees exists
 Correct, right yep, okay
 So other aspects of what a grant is how can we don't hear about this more and also is this something that you know
 Are there ones that we should avoid and are there ones that have to be paid back? Yeah, so question mark suit guys a perfect example of why we don't hear about them more
 If you start the algorithms and you start looking for grants right and then Google says oh you want to know more about grants
 You're all shove them to you the vast majority of that stuff is gonna be kind of fraudulent
 Just like the question mark suit guy he was making money off selling this book
 He wasn't doing anything to help you actually get grants as then provide you with just
 Ridiculous amount of organizations that have at some point in the past provide you the grant for something whether that information is updated
 Or no, I can't imagine that it's updated a published book because the grant space is changing every day
 There's new grants coming out and stuff like that, but anyway
 There's a lot of online resources that will say hey, we'll help you get a grant pay us the fee to have access to our amazing list of grants
 And we'll show you all this free money that you can get so a lot of the resources out there that people might stumble on that
 Don't know what they're looking for
 Unfortunately, we'll be taking advantage of them because the real grant information is
 Is available for free
 Hey, you don't have to pay to get access to this stuff
 You just have to know where to look in the proper places to look so
 That's
 One reason why we don't hear about them because the algorithm isn't showing you the it or the information that you might be seeing is gonna be kind of
 Frigilin or questionable stuff that you know sounds too good to be true and most of the time it is
 So what you're saying is we can't rely on Google for accurate information
 I
 If you hear it that way yes, that's what I'm saying I'm afraid of saying what I'm saying because
 Google to hear it
 But I told you it was listening to our show, but hey, yeah the other thing that that's exactly how people go about
 Researching I mean people don't know
 Right, I don't know how to go get a grant. I don't know where to find a grant
 I assume I just Google it and Google is gonna give me the great information right the other thing is that the
 Organizations that are offering the grants they don't necessarily have a whole lot of money to spend in marketing
 And so
 It's not like a Coca-Cola, you know, where it's like they've got a ton of money to spend in marketing and when everybody go buy a Coca-Cola
 And the reason for that also is the organizations that are offering these grants the people that they want the grants
 for
 are very aware of
 these
 Of where to find the grants and so
 Anyway, every state every city and county they have what is called
 Economic Development District or the state has an economic development
 Agency for the state
 And that is where all the grant information is gonna be for your county for your city for your state
 Will be held in your economic development district
 Okay, so if I am going to go and look for a grant
 This is the place I start
 Yeah, yeah, you will just type in your state
 in the Google right type in your state economic development district or EDD
 And it will come up so like for Oregon is called
 Our state's economic development district is called business Oregon and on the business Oregon website is all of the
 Information that you would ever need to find out what grants are out there and and you know if there's one that fits
 You know my my thing whatever I do
 No are there so as we dig in I'm sure there's a ton is there stuff that we want to avoid what are grants and things that we want to avoid
 Well, you if you the people giving the grant if you don't have it
 If there's not a really good reason why you should be awarded that thing you're not going to get it so
 I think it would be tough for you to get involved in a grant that
 You really should have avoided but there's certain intricate things about grants that you should know about to know if you
 If it's good for you or not like there's some grants that will pay you the money up front
 There's other grants that are reimbursement grants that you have to spend the money before you're going to get the money
 But when it's all said and done in your project management is all you know proper
 You will know how much money you will spend when it's all said and done and you will know how much money you will get back
 There's also grants a lot of them will be
 Mad they will have a matching component that you will not receive any of the money until you've spent
 15% of the total grant award until you've spent that on your own and then after you spend that 15% of the total grant award
 Then you will start to receive the money from the grant so if you don't have any money to spend
 But you're just trying to get the free money then that would be one that you would need to avoid but again
 That would all be washed out in your RFP process and
 Like an interview process and stuff like that so you would it would be hard to get involved in that grant or be awarded that grant with those
 Criteria without you knowing that that was a criteria right that was a part of the criteria
 So but there are some aspects of like different grants are different so some you're gonna get the money of front
 Some you're gonna have to spend money before you get it some you're gonna have to
 Spend your own money before you even start getting the reimbursement or whatever the case is
 So
 And then the last part of that question do they have to be paid back the answer is no if you
 Complete your project has
 Talked about it's like a contract you're entering into a contract we will give you this money if you do this thing that you've described this project
 That you put together if you end up getting through that
 Grant period and you don't complete your part of the deal
 Then you would in in a lot of cases have to pay that money back
 The amazing thing is how contradictory this is to like that
 You know
 Informers show what the dude running around is all you need is this book and then all this money is gonna follow your direction
 There's actually a lot of work in this what is the RFP process look like
 Yeah, it is it is very
 Detailed it is it is very much like a job application often times it is a competition
 There's a lot of people that are gonna submit RFPs and and
 Then the committee the grant committee or whoever they typically will receive all of them
 They will read about your project they will determine you know how close how does it align with what they're trying to accomplish the ultimate goal
 They will have some sort of a point like a grading system where they will apply points to your application and
 You know determine who's gonna be the winner right so it's very competitive
 There is a whole just like you have a bunch of people that could like you know that are professionals in writing resumes
 The same thing here there's organizations out there that will hire grant writers people with a very specific skill of being able to write grants in a specific
 vernacular with with you know a very specific way of writing so that it will speak to those people who are
 Reviewing the grants in a way that makes them believe that your project is the best project to be awarded
 Yeah, so that might not work. Yeah, it's a lot of work. It's not just you know
 You buy a book and all of a sudden you know a couple which we have a lot of money
 So
 question is who can actually get a grant?
 Yeah, so this is interesting the the unfortunate thing is that a lot of
 Entrepreneurs because I think of this stigma right is this question mark suit guy I wish we knew his name or whatever
 But uh
 Yeah, that that
 Make people think that there's just free money out there go get it. It's easy. You know, it's really not easy and
 so prior to COVID
 Grants for profit companies entrepreneurs was almost non-existent
 I mean think about it if you think about the the scenario that I the example I gave of like the government needs something
 Your organization can help them get to that end goal so that it's worth it for them to give you the money to go do it right
 What is the government benefit from just giving you money to grow your business or to start up your business?
 They they don't necessarily benefit from that. I mean there there is a large argument
 We can talk hours on on that topic all by itself, but generally speaking the government's not just going to give any
 Entrepreneur money just to go start a business and just try it out and see how it goes. Yeah, the start doesn't actually
 benefit the country right exactly business and so
 Prior to COVID grants for for profit businesses was almost non-existent. There is however a
 Like a seasonality to it sometimes depending on what's going on in the world in the country whatever
 Sometimes there are things that happen that
 Grants for for profit businesses do happen, but generally speaking
 They don't exist when COVID came that flipped upside down. They were given grant money to just anybody and everybody
 So the for profit thing really became
 A possibility where you could go out and get grant money for for profit business
 So a lot of grants are mostly available to non-profits
 It's another reason why I think this topic is so important because we have a lot of clients who are for profit businesses and entrepreneurs and
 Wasting a lot of time trying to pursue this
 Piped dream trying to pursue this pie in the sky that they could go out and get this free money and they're just wasting their time because it
 Really just doesn't exist for for profits
 Generally speaking
 So if you are a for profit which I think most of the people listening to this probably are operating a for profit business
 Why does this conversation even matter?
 Yeah because there are opportunities for for profit grants and typically those are in the economic development space
 So what does that mean how does that work so in Oregon? I'm going to use Oregon as an example
 Oregon because this is a this will be very obvious are very easy to understand
 Oregon is a non-sales tax state
 So they don't make tax money
 From just sales happening in our state
 So they have to make tax money from something else what do we what is the state of Oregon?
 How do they run their business right? How do they get the money to run their business as a state
 And that's through income tax and property tax so
 The more jobs that are created in the state of Oregon equals more money for the state of Oregon
 So economic development grants are widely available here in Oregon for for profit
 So that if the government could give you as Chris as the business owner more money to grow your business
 With the end goal being that you end up with more jobs when it's all set and done
 Then the government will be able to recoup their money and they in fact make money off of you
 From the jobs that you created
 Not only that as you create more jobs living wage jobs then you provide more people the opportunity to
 Buy a new house or as you expand your business you will buy a new building
 You will expand your building they will be able to generate more money for the state
 By property taxes and income taxes and so there is a lot of
 Opportunity for for profit
 Companies to get grants in the economic development space if you could build our economy we will give you money because when it's all set and done
 If the government if the state or the you know counting government or the city government can
 Spend a million dollars to help local businesses grow
 But they will be able to you know net
 Several more millions of dollars in tax money than it's worth it for them so this is where you know
 I think
 So many people look at government decision making and government you know how they operate their business as just they don't know what the heck they're doing and
 And so many cases people are absolutely correct
 But if you look at this from the business sense it makes sense it makes sense why and that we're talking specifically speaking to state
 Grants right at this moment, but the state is hedging itself and saying that if we can create more jobs
 Maybe we will draw more people from other you know first off if anybody's not employed then that that drops that rate
 It gets more people making money the more people making money
 That we're gonna tax their income
 We're gonna tax you know if they own homes
 We're gonna tax their properties so if we can get more businesses going then the people who are unemployed in our state
 That's gonna create more revenues so if we throw out a million dollars here
 We're hoping as a state that it's gonna come back and ten million dollars down here
 And on top of that if we can continue to grow and we have something to offer you know
 Hey, let's promote the beauty and the amazingness of the organ coast or you know the you know the
 The pine trees and the mountains and this and this and this and this and this and we can start drawing people in
 You know, I know
 That's something that people love about
 You know ten of sea is that there are aspects that they're not taxed on and it does tend to draw some folks
 To a state like Tennessee
 But if we can draw more people in then as we bring those folks in obviously you had to have the ability to move here and
 Pay for yourself to be here which should create the opportunity for more income tax and more property tax
 So really from the state aspect this is you know
 It's not looking at this going hey we're stealing
 the tax money of the everyday worker
 The hope for the the state is that hey we're doing this so that we can create more revenue
 That we can utilize in the state as a business period correct absolutely yep
 Is it the same on the federal level it is
 Generally speaking everything I've talked about with the grants is to see there's really no difference between like state
 county
 city
 or even
 federal often times
 The grant money you're getting from the state came from a grant that the state got from the federal government
 Federal government says hey we need to do this and this each of all the states they submitted RFP to the government saying
 Our people can do that give me the money so I give it to my people in my state to go do that thing
 And then it's it's grant money that's given to grant
 To give out more grant money to you know to each individual state
 And this is where we are taxing the individuals
 Which obviously there's gonna be a decent this is where people are probably gonna be frustrated with while but if I'm paying my taxes then and
 You know in my state and some other states getting that money well why isn't that coming back to my state so there is a
 An understanding that this can be a frustration for some who would you agree?
 Totally and it's so confusing right what's
 How could this be confusing Chris it?
 Right exactly the government right?
 Yeah, it's pretty clear. I think that some people would think it's clear but
 Unfortunately all those people just are the ones doing it in the government. It's not clear to anybody else
 I know I'm gonna probably screw this up, but I think you know Regions said the worst a word words
 I know you know I'm from the government. I'm here to help or something like that
 But at the end of the day what we're still looking at is
 Is there the opportunity?
 Somebody is going to get this this is gonna go out there
 Do you have the ability and again while they're limited for the poor profits?
 Is there the opportunity for you to create something that is going to not only take care of you and your team members and their families and so on and so forth and
 Your customers and your vendors but in the long run. It's also gonna be a benefit
 to those that are giving the grants as well
 So third question is do you want to really want a grant?
 This is the most important part. I mean other than understanding what a grant is
 Man
 This this is the question you have to ask yourself and you have to understand it's not necessarily
 Just free money go get it and let's have a party
 you are so the moment that you
 Commit to getting this grant and you go through the process and you are awarded this grant money
 you have you now have
 Another person a new person to answer to as a business owner we typically don't answer to anybody other than our clients and our team
 In that aspect, but I mean we don't necessarily have a boss
 When you say yes to the grant money you sign on the line and you start receiving that grant money
 You have a new boss and it's the government
 It's this industry
 No problem with that right there
 No problem having the KGB over your shoulder right it's this entity that you got the grant money now
 There is this is the side of grants that I don't think most people don't if you've never gotten a grant yourself
 You all you probably don't know that this happens
 There is a reporting process there is a check in process you have a new boss that will be calling on you and asking you
 How things are going where is the money where did you spend it?
 I need my quarterly report the report has to consist of all of this information so we could keep track
 And make sure you're doing what you said you were going to do with the money
 I mean it is a whole another level of accounting
 It is you're creating a whole new job for yourself
 They want receipts for everything they want proof of everything
 And there is a timeline that you have to do it by and this is like serious stuff
 And so if you as an entrepreneur not ready to have a new boss
 Specifically that boss being the government in some aspect
 That in grant is not for you you really don't want the grant you think you might want the free money
 But you really don't want it
 You there is that there is so much stuff that has to happen
 That you that you are tied to there is no way around it once you say yes you are you're in for the long haul and you've you've got somebody else to answer to
 Moving forward so one of the things one of the things we talked about
 In next level mastermind
 You know with all of our leaders and business owners is that quite often
 A business owner and entrepreneur
 Actually becomes that because they are tired of somebody telling them what to do they don't want
 Somebody over the shoulder they don't want that much
 Input into what they're doing as far as a business goes
 So why would I want to do this as a business owner what I mean obviously you know
 Definitely it's giving me the ability to
 Have somebody to make something happen or push something forward
 Show me the scale here what what what are the pros and cons what what outways the cons what the pros
 Well, I mean money is is got it carries a lot of weight, right?
 there
 There might be something that you've always wanted to do but you just
 You know you don't have the capital to take care of it or
 The resources or whatever the cases and and this could be the thing that gets you
 To a point that could take your business to it, you know another level that you've
 Had on your list right of like your wish list or things like that
 There's so many great aspects to it of what you're trying to do and how a grant can help you get there
 I love the idea of grants and I worked off grants for for three years in the nonprofit
 my one of my businesses has personally received two grants that has helped us
 Take things to another level
 So there are some great opportunities the the most important thing about this conversation is
 To just really understand what it is and what you're getting into
 So that you're not wasting a whole I've also seen the other side of it where entrepreneurs are just so dead focused on getting this free money and they waste so much time and energy
 On something they don't even know what it is they're asking for and then and then once they get it they get there and then they're like what did I do like
 Why did I want this? This isn't what I thought it was because they just had no idea
 And so that's the most important thing is I don't want to see our clients and the listeners of this podcast
 spend a whole lot of time and resources in this
 This fake thing of free money
 Would if they fully understood what they were what they were getting into they could determine if it was worth their time and in efforts
 You know before going all the way through
 I think that's that last sentence there that last phrase is the part
 That anybody who's considering this needs to understand
 If your focus is I do not want
 Anybody looking over my shoulder don't go this direction you know if your focus is I want to 100%
 be
 You know
 Self-sufficient telling myself what to do nobody's input yadiyada. I'd great
 Grants or not for you it doesn't matter grant not for you if
 You can wait this out man if I got a million dollars to go do this thing
 Could I have the focus of having to report on and give information on and show progress on
 You know yadiyada for the next number of years
 Is that level of reporting
 Something that's worth it to me because if I you know my idea is amazing
 You know this million dollars might I might be able to turn that into
 $100 million right by if I do this correctly or or get the million or 20 million or whatever
 And so because of that it would be worth
 the energy and the outputs of reporting on what we're doing until that is over because what's it so over
 Once the grant writing is or what's the grants over once that time period and I'd love to read it with those timelines look like
 But once that timeline is over we're essentially severing that relationship, right?
 Yeah, totally the only thing that might connect it forever is you remember right there's there's always got to be something in it for them
 The people giving you the money right
 So that IP that they paid you to create they might be able to have access to it forever you created it for them
 You created it for you and you will be able to use it and do whatever you do with it or whatever
 But you also created it for them and so they will continue to be able to use it also in their capacity
 And that's the whole reason why they gave you the money is to create the thing
 So there might be a relationship there that you always have but when the grant period is over
 The reporting is over you spent the money you did what you said you were going to do they gave you the money
 You completed it and it's over
 Yeah, and I think if you really think about it
 The thing that is probably looming over this whole discussion is the word government
 Because if we want to venture capitalist
 What's the difference?
 You know if you went to somebody who's going to poor money into your business
 Which by the way if they take a piece of your business then they always own that piece of business
 And unless you've got something in another that says that a certain point you buy them back out
 But if you it's no different than going to somebody who's going to
 You know if you go to venture capitalist is going to give you money in dollars
 They don't go away. It's not like they're they don't want to understand whether or not you're doing something with that money
 They want to see that you're doing something with that money
 Right, they want to understand there's going to be reporting all that kind of fun stuff
 I think the big key here is the question of do I trust the government? Well if you're willing to understand
 What goes into this the amount of effort on the front side?
 The amount of effort during the process in reporting all that kind of fun stuff and you're willing to say that amount of work is
 Were you know if I get this X number of dollars and by the way do you know if they're I can't imagine there's an average
 Grant amount like they've looked across all of them and it's like oh it's two point four million
 Is there any average amount?
 They're they're private if you go with them. Sure. It'll come up with some sort of number
 But no, I don't know my it's all over. It's all over. It's all over. Yeah, it's just crazy
 But you know, but for if I'm able to get this dollar
 Am I willing to put this effort into it? So I think that's the thing that you've got to understand so folks
 Here's the thing that I want you to know and I hopefully you're getting out of this
 If you're struggling in this area or any area of your business where
 You're not getting the greater perspective like this show
 I think there's a good number of you out there that are listening to this that now are are really gaining greater
 Perspective
 Opportunities that you have do I think you should not go and get a grant no that's not at all do I think you should not necessarily
 What is the key? It's getting to the right perspective that fits you it's getting to the right perspective
 That helps you in your leadership
 Make the right decisions for you. So if you're a solopronor this might be just this sounds fantastic
 I want you know I can go get this money. I don't mind doing a little bit of reporting but guess what if you're a solopronor
 You've got to do all the work of the reporting as well. You've got to do the RFP process. I mean, let's you can face
 I buddy, you know you've got to you've got to put a lot of effort into this. What if you were a
 somewhat larger you know small business
 That has people that I can administer a lovely handle all of that reporting and handle those and it takes that level of stress off of you

 So with all of this let's pull all of this together
 Justin what I would love for you to do is kind of summarize what we're talking about here.
 Summarize the thoughts and the offerings the advice on the offerings all that kind of fun stuff
 and do you have specific recommendations?
 Yeah, so
 understand the idea of there's trillions and trillions of dollars of free money just sitting out there for you to just go get
 it's it's it's not quite that. That there's a process and it is either for you or it's not for you
 and I don't want you to you know waste a whole lot of time and resources and in chasing this
 this free money without understanding you know what you're getting into and what all
 what all is required of you during that grant process and all that stuff. There are some great opportunities
 for you to go out and find some grants that could help you grow your business and do some great things
 for your business, for your community, for your for your state you know things like that.
 So don't be deterred by any of the things that we're saying but just get that knowledge and
 understand what it is you're actually wishing for and make sure that you really want what you're
 wishing for. Exactly and it's so important again to get advice from somebody who knows who's been there
 has gone through this process and actually knows exactly what that looks like and what you're
 going to experience. So how do you folks get started with the grant process right now?
 Yeah so remember I talked about the economic development district so you have a local
 either within your city or your county for sure you will have a local economic development district and
 then your state has an economic development district also locally another organization that
 that could help you get connected into the real you know places to go find real grants.
 We'll be your local SPDC or small business development center. Your chamber of commerce they will have
 access to those resources as well. Those people are in the grants space all the time. The grant space
 is changing all the time there's new grants that come out all the time and they could they are very
 it's very likely that they are up to speed with what's coming out what's just currently come out
 timelines and things like that. And so build a relationship with those organizations locally and
 they will be great resources to help you navigate through. The even the SPDC can help you
 write the grant. They could help you go through the process of making sure you do a good job in
 preparing all of your information for the grant and things like that if you've never done it before.
 phenomenal and obviously you as an expert in this area have done this multiple times before there's
 a reason you've had great reasons to make this happen and put this to success or we would
 definitely not be talked about this today. So thank you brother I appreciate you joining me on the show
