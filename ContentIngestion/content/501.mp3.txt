 What does emotion really mean and should it even be a goal and how do we get ourselves positioned for it?
 That is coming up next.
 Welcome to the Crystal Cardo Show where we discuss leadership and life and
 discover that business is what you do not who you are.
 Welcome to the show folks.
 Hope you're having a fabulous day wherever you are.
 We're having a pretty good day here.
 Once again, I am joined by the fabulous, the talented, the, what else?
 What do we got to say here?
 Jules says that I'm illustrious.
 A lustreous, illustrious, the illustrious Brian.
 Welcome back.
 Thank you.
 Good to be here.
 What about you through one like one descriptor that was just like a, be, the flexible.
 What does that even mean?
 Let's know.
 There's no context.
 For all the people that just took that in a dirty way, that's not what that meant.
 Oh my god.
 Good.
 Come on.
 People get out of the gutter.
 Welcome back, right?
 What are we talking about today?
 We've got a fun spend.
 Well, we, you and I think it's fun.
 Hopefully everybody else thinks it's fun.
 We'll see.
 We have a fun little spin here.
 We'll see how this goes.
 It's fun for us.
 We've got another how to episode where I'm going to set up a question that we've got.
 Maybe try to unpack a little bit of our terminology at the beginning here.
 Then I'm going to just pitch it over to you to do a soft ball spike.
 Yes.
 The soft ball spike.
 The brine Alex isn't.
 And knock it out of the park.
 That's what we're anticipating.
 We have to kind of explain that for a quick second.
 I don't remember what I don't remember the situation, but it was something.
 You're like, soft ball spike.
 I'm not my sports metaphor.
 I just come back from Sicily to live into states.
 This is a couple of years ago.
 And I was on one of your shows early on.
 And I think I just, I mixed metaphors.
 That's all.
 It's been a long time.
 Not been left in there.
 No shame.
 Oh yeah.
 No shame.
 All right.
 Lots of shame.
 Lots of continued kidding throughout the years.
 But no shame.
 No shame.
 All right.
 As you would say, minimal shame.
 Minimal.
 The bare minimum.
 Serious.
 Minimal judgment.
 Minimal judgment.
 Oh my gosh.
 Well, today.
 You know, hey, look, we're coming up to the end of the year.
 And I know as we approach that that little gap, that window of time and the holidays
 that week before new years, most minds go to reflecting on the year that we've just come out of.
 It's been been a long year for some of us.
 And how we're positioned, how it's looking for the next year.
 Of course, a lot of us think about,
 well, what do I want to be different in my life?
 You know, where am I heading?
 And am I growing?
 And hopefully, you know, as people have been going through some of our more recent episodes, we talked about a lot of
 job stuff, how to make a fresh start.
 We talked about a lot of personality and even character stuff.
 Why character counts was one of our episodes.
 We talked about developing a personal growth plan.
 And, you know, leading up here to this reflection time.
 I thought it'd be good to talk about promotion.
 And we're going to unpack the word and then I'm going to pitch it over to you to swing at it.
 But here's here's kind of the set up for it.
 You have to put your life together yourself.
 Nobody's going to do that for you.
 If you don't like where you are, it's based on the decisions that you've made.
 You can change that.
 And thought by thought action by action,
 we can start to get out of the ruts that we've been in and going down the right path, the path that we want to be.
 And really, you know, just to be honest, because I know this word is used a lot nowadays.
 It's not, it's not what we've done that defines us so much as what we're going to do next.
 And what I mean is maybe you've been through bankruptcy in this year.
 Maybe you've been through surgery.
 Maybe you've been through divorce prison grief.
 The loss of a loved one.
 Whatever you've been through, you know, if you're like most people, you try to attach a title.
 You know, I'm a cancer survivor.
 I've been through bankruptcy.
 I'm a divorcee.
 I'm a felon.
 You know, I've just been let out of prison.
 Whatever it is, you know, I lost a loved one.
 All of those things begin to define us.
 But really, we're defined by what we're doing next in our decision making processes.
 And so it's, it's not our failure.
 It's not the tragedy that you've been through.
 But a lot of that failure mentality can haunt us.
 And it can become a bigger obstacle to us than what we've actually been through.
 We tend to suffer more because of the way we think about things rather than the things themselves.
 And so what are we, what are you saying today?
 You know, in, in going after growth and transformation, we have to understand it's a, it's a pain's taking process.
 It's a one day at a time, one decision at a time process.
 But this gives you control over where you're going.
 And so I wanted to pause at the end of this year thinking about the, the year coming up and give people a world of
 people, a word, not a word from God.
 But just a word to think about in kind of room, you know, chew on a little bit.
 And that word is promotion.
 And I started looking at this word.
 It comes from the Latin and it's promo vera.
 And I say that with a bit of an Italian accent.
 I don't know if that's right for Latin or not.
 But that's how I hear it.
 It's all, but it, but it means it simply means to move forward.
 It's all it means.
 It's motion, it's action, it's movement, it's progress.
 And so that's what we're talking about moving towards and end moving towards the goal.
 And I mean, you know, in my life, I want to be using my skills and gifts that God's given me this year,
 this coming year in the best way, even better even more than I have in this, this previous year.
 I want to become all that he's created me to be and not be holding back his plan for my life because of the
 roots that I get myself in.
 And we've talked a lot about that this year.
 And I want to have success.
 And you know, even that word success is interesting.
 It comes from Latin again.
 And it just means to advance to, it means like, a coming up.
 It means going to the next level, which we talk about a lot.
 We teach people in next level of life how to take their lives to the next level, get out of the
 roots that they're in. And so I want to put that as the bull's eye for this coming year.
 How do I position myself for promotion? What can I see myself succeeding in and going to the next level in and overcoming the obstacles that have been holding me back in my life?
 And so that's where that's where we are.
 How do I position myself for pro motion going forward in life next year?
 Well, that's easy.
 That's easy.
 It's too crazy.
 We're just going to tweet it out because it's 104 or 14.
 And done.
 And it's so.
 The answer is be in the right places at the right time.
 There you go.
 That's it.
 All right.
 When we keep enjoying the show.
 Yes.
 Yeah.

 And you're at the right place.
 And you're at the right place.
 And you're at the right place.
 And you're at the right place.
 And you're at the right place.
 And then you have to ask yourself, actually, you should probably start, well, let's, let's back
 it up and start with this.
 Are you willing to do something about it?
 If you get to a place and see that you can be in a better position, a year for now, you can
 be in a better position career, financial, social, family.
 If you can be in a better position, a better place, are you willing to do something about it?
 What if it takes some hard work?
 What if it takes some healthy boundaries?
 What if it takes being less selfish?
 Right?
 Right?
 What if it takes better personal care, not the same ridiculous thing that's being preached out there
 in the world of self care, which is everything's all about you and the world's on your shoulders
 and the world owes you.
 And you should just spend your days in a spa.
 Not talking about that crappy message.
 I'm talking about literally taking care of your health, taking care of your mental well-being,
 taking care of your focus and study on relationship with God.
 You know, what if it takes some of these difficult things?
 Are you willing to do it?
 If you're not willing to do it, if you just want to see what life could be like, but then you're
 going to just stick where you are, probably don't listen to the rest of the show because
 it's just going to be a waste of time.
 And I don't think anybody listening to the show is actually not ready or not willing to do
 something about it.
 So starting with that self assessment, where am I?
 So before I go any further, any questions on any of those pieces or anything that we should be
 in.
 I think it's entirely appropriate.
 And it's in line with where we've been going this entire year, which if we were to put a banner
 or title a theme, it's about self assessment it really is.
 And I like that coming to the end of the year here, we can look even categorically because we've
 taken some deep dives along the way into specific categories.
 And I like that we're kind of zooming out here.
 And so yeah, you can Google Zig Zigler Wheel of Life.
 You can go to Chrissacurter.com and just type in our search bar, Wheel of Life.
 You can find our version on it, the exact one that Chris is talking about right now.
 And do that assessment.
 And I think, you know, I've done that a few times and we've even done that together as a
 team and it's been--
 There's a new have an assessment on there.
 Yeah, as well.
 And we've done that as a team as well in some of our preparation for teaching.
 And going through that process, man, it can be a little tough.
 You don't always find the things that, well, there's things in there, you hope you don't
 find, you know?
 Right.
 And you're kind of opening that box up and taking a look at, you know, I took my car to the
 mechanic the other day thinking I was getting a routine oil change and, you know, they
 jacked the car up.
 He said, hey, Brian, take a look at this.
 Looked under the hood and man, there was something broke that shouldn't be broke and it's
 dangerous.
 And, you know, I've got this team of people coming in on the weekend.
 And so I was getting the car ready and I thought, oh, wow, you know, thank you, Lord,
 that I got in here.
 I put the car up on stilts, you know, and looked under the hood and all that stuff.
 And found something before it damaged me and possibly others over the next couple of days.
 And I kind of wonders, that what we're doing here right now, just in this assessment process.
 And, you know, maybe you tuned in because of the title, how to position yourself for promotion.
 But that's exactly what we're doing.
 And you've got to assess, you've got to be willing to look honestly in the mirror, you know,
 the words of the philosopher Michael Jackson.
 And you've got to be able to talk to that man in the mirror and decide if you're willing to make
 some changes and it starts here.
 It starts with me.
 And, you know, if I want something different, if I want promotion, if I want success, if I want
 to go to the next level, I've got to start with an honest assessment of where I am and how
 I'm holding myself back.
 So yeah, I love it.
 And I think that is a new series for us breaking down the philosophical Michael Jackson songs
 in relating to our lives.
 That's that's all.
 That's fat.
 I love that you just put all of that in there.
 That was great.
 So, with that being said, I think you pointed out one of the first steps in that self assessment.
 And that is, you know, we always start with the positives.
 What is positive about this area of my life right now, this area of the wheel of life right
 now.
 And focus on what does that look like?
 Because the reason why we do this is because many people can go to the negative very quickly and
 never see anything positive.
 So we always push the positive.
 What is positive?
 What are we experiencing?
 All that kind of fun stuff.
 So that we can have those that understanding and start there.
 But we also need to lift up the hood and see what's broken.
 So as we go through some of the things that are negative, you know, if you did tune in to
 find out how do you get a promotion at work, well, let's start with career.
 How am I doing in my career, right?
 Now, here's my suggestion.
 And I always tell people, it's really difficult for team members to seek a leader and say, tell
 me what's wrong with me.
 Tell me what I'm not doing well.
 Tell me what I can change, what I can adjust.
 That's really difficult.
 Why?
 Because the last thing you want is to hear things that your leader doesn't think you're doing
 well, right?
 Well, here's the crazy thing.
 If they have answers, that means it's already in their head.
 And it gives you the opportunity to learn and grow, right?
 So I tell people, hey, listen, don't shy away from asking, you know, what can I do better?
 What do you sing that I'm struggling with?
 We have another Brian up here, Brian Dudley, who works up here at the Ridge.
 And I love that one day he just texted me and he's like, dude, what do I do that
 and noise you?
 I was just like, I love that you asked that question, right?
 There wasn't an answer for anything annoying.
 But I had some answers on some other things.
 If like, hey, here's some things to look out for, here's some things to watch.
 And it was just a really good, mature conversation.
 And I'd just, you know, I never did ask him, what brought that on?
 And I think I know what it is.
 I think it's him seeing other people not do, you know, we have a lot of people that show
 up here and vendors and things going on.
 And so I think it's possible him looking at things and him seeing things that are knowing him
 and asking him the South the question, what am I doing?
 That's annoying Chris, right?
 And I think it was such a great way of him to dig into a question.
 And instead of getting answers on things being annoying, he gets answers on, hey, here's
 some things you could do better or something.
 Here's something you could work on, right?
 And it turned out to be a fantastic thing for him to just go, oh, great, good to know.
 And I think really everything was more personality style of just communication or something like that.
 Let me ask you this.
 After he asked you that question, did you think more of him less of him or the same?
 Well, I fired him.
 Okay.
 So that's a good thing that it watched out for.
 Never ask your boss what you could do.
 Doing better.
 Yeah, exactly.
 Of course.
 I thought I thought so much higher of him.
 Is that moment?
 Yeah.
 We shy away from that.
 It's the craziest thing.
 Right?
 So, you know, as the guy who gained so much perspective and teaches people to gain perspective,
 I don't have a problem asking people questions.
 Right?
 I want to know, hey, what do you think about this?
 What do you see here?
 What's your opinion?
 I have no problem walking through those pieces, right?
 But teaching people to do the same sometimes is so difficult because they have to get past
 those fears.
 So the amazing thing is, is I thought so much more highly of him because he was seeking it.
 He wanted to know.
 And it was just a legit, I really want to know what you think.
 And it gave me the ability to speak in on areas that he could make adjustments to.
 Now if he does, great, if he doesn't, well, that might be a different discussion, right?
 But the crazy thing is, is there's already things as a leader that you look at on
 every team member and you already stockpile things in your head.
 If it's things that you can adjust or you try to work with them on.
 Now somebody for somebody like me, I am going to try and work with somebody to the point
 that they will allow me to work with them.
 If I see that somebody is not going to be able to receive stuff and it doesn't affect their
 role, it doesn't change where they are.
 They're just not ready for it.
 Then I'm going to back off early in my leadership years.
 I used to push people on things that I could see.
 And unfortunately, they weren't ready for it.
 So I've learned if it doesn't affect what they're doing back off at some point when they're
 ready, then you know, I can speak into that.
 But to have somebody come after it, man, that's just fabulous, right?
 So saying all this to say, what are you?
 Where are you in your role?
 Where are you with your leader?
 Where are you with other team members?
 Are you looking for perspective from other people?
 Well, gosh, no, Chris, because then that would give them power.
 It literally doesn't give anybody power.
 Besides the fact that they've already got it in their heads, their answers are there.
 It's not something that they're going to come up with.
 It's not like they're going to stop and go, oh gosh, I don't know.
 If there's anything that you do, that's annoying or wrong or bad.
 Let me spend 15 minutes thinking about it.
 It's going to be something that they've already got somewhat of an opinion on.
 Just think about it.
 You probably have opinions on people that you work with.
 So the key is is healthy people.
 I would not go ask unhealthy people that question.
 I would not go seek somebody who wants to take me down a notch or somebody who's unhealthy
 or somebody struggling with control or manipulation or somebody who's a people pleaser.
 As we talked about on the past shows.
 That question.
 Why?
 Because I don't think I'm going to get an honest answer.
 I'm looking for honesty.
 I'm looking for something that I can use and move forward with.
 So if I can dig in pop the hood up and find what's broken, then instead of worrying about where
 I'm going to be, how about I fix what's broken now?
 One of the things we do in Stratplan up, the big success.
 Why Stratplan is so successful for so many businesses.
 We're not selling, now we, on average, finding, I think it's one million dollars more in the
 next 12 months than they were planning on.
 That's a fantastic benefit.
 We're not selling an event that teaches people how to go make more money.
 Why?
 Because making more money is not your issue.
 Every single business that comes in, if we say, hey, if we double your revenue next week,
 what would happen, they have one or two answers.
 98% of people say we would self implode.
 There's no way we could handle it.
 Then there's this 2% that go, oh, we could totally handle that.
 Then we have a different issue.
 We are well over staffed.
 We have too much capacity.
 We have to go different direction.
 Either way, the answer still reveals something.
 For 98% of people, we have too many things holding us back.
 We couldn't handle that type of growth right now.
 Then quick going after tons of money.
 Let's solve the things that are wrong right now.
 That's what we do with next level of life.
 That's what we do with this process.
 How do we discover the things in our finances that are holding us back?
 Are we emotional spending?
 Are we not living on a budget?
 Do we not think that it's important?
 Are we not on the same page with our spouse?
 What is our physical being?
 Are we running ourselves to death?
 Are we running ourselves, racket?
 Are we allowing ourselves to stress too much?
 Are we stress eating?
 Are we eating crap that is causing us to feel horrible?
 Are we eating sugar all the time so that we can light up our pleasure centers so we can
 avoid the pain of the conflicts that we're living with?
 All of these different things.
 What is my relationship with God?
 I spending enough time focusing on him, learning him, growing in him, or am I letting somebody
 else tell me what I'm supposed to believe one hour a week and feeling like I've got a
 really good relationship with God.
 As we lift the pop the hood and we take a look around what's broken, what are the things
 that we need to focus on so if I want to be in a better place, so think about it right
 now as your car fixed yet.
 No, it's not okay.
 He's still working on it.
 So promotion is getting back to normal.
 Yeah.
 We're supposed to be.
 To move forward.
 Literally.
 So literally.
 Literally move the car forward, right?
 So just even forget about where I want to be a year from now, if things are broken in
 my life, if things need to be fixed right now, how about I just get back to normal?
 I hate to use the word normal.
 How about I get back to where I should be or where I was?
 Let's fix that instead of trying to get ahead and still having broken pieces that eventually
 when they do break the rest of the car, everything shuts down, right?
 I mean, I think the easy analogy is going back to the physical being, right?
 If I don't fix the things that are wrong with me physically, then eventually my body shuts
 down.
 And I think I'm going to be a little bit more focused on the way to the right.

 Really painful painstaking process of changing my thoughts about a certain area of my life changing my actions, my decision making and being willing to face it and deal with it.
 And again, I'm wondering maybe there's somebody else out there that's in that same boat where I find myself often of I'm just going to you know,
 I think and not and pretend you know I've got these rose colored glass everything's fine it still runs everything you know nothing to see here close the curtain you know it's just hide it sweep it under the rug but man this is a great time of year.
 I think that's tend to slow down a little bit maybe you've got some time off from work maybe you're thinking about this this year that's gone by and you know maybe it's a healthy practice to to assess at the end of a day what happened today.
 Where did I win where did I lose where did I fail what can I do better where's my relationship with the Lord how am I you know just doing that personal assessment that meditative and reflective.
 Pause at the end of the day or at the end of the month or here we are at the end of the year it can be painful but oh my gosh I'm so glad I'm going to get my car back tomorrow fixed and I I know it's going to go in the direction I want it to if I do that with these other areas.
 I am positioning myself for pro motion to go to the next level yeah so necessary that's if those Sicilians can fix your car build.
 We are both we're both Sicilian then.
 The Italians have their way with cars man I tell you they they have they have some fine automobiles over here they know what's going on under the hood.
 So hey can you soup this thing up can you put a Ferrari in here come on.
 This is a 20 year old French car a poojo.
 No they're like piece of crap right when you got upgrade your car.
 The problem is the chain fell off the pedals that's your problem.
 The motor is getting slower the older I get I don't know what's going on.
 Those hills are just you had a couple of great things one of those is you know am I looking at myself and saying am I emotionally spending.
 Here's so the financial one is actually it's an interesting area that people don't care.
 They don't they don't care they don't want to know and if they do know they don't have a problem.
 Because people are like well I deserve it if I'm emotionally spending.
 Who are you to judge me do you know how hard I work so here as you hit that I've heard these voices.

 I'm looking at reality, but that ignoring the problem doesn't make it go away.
 In fact, oftentimes, I'll throw in a dental metaphor now.
 Look, you know, allowing a cavity to grow.
 The tooth falls out at some point.
 I know.
 I know.
 I've been there.
 But we don't want, you know, that abscess to go on.
 You want to deal with the cavities, deal with what's going on.
 Why?
 Why?
 Because we're about health.
 Not just on the functionality side, but health for growth.
 And that is positioning yourself for promotion.
 Absolutely.
 Absolutely.
 So with that, there you go.
 There's some great steps to move forward.
 If you're going to move forward in life.
 And by the way, if you're able to get all seven areas focused on and moving forward, then
 guess what your life moves forward.
 Life doesn't look the same.
 That's another piece with next level of life is we look at these seven areas.
 We put all these steps to, hey, I'm going to go do this.
 This is just this.
 All these things over the next three, six, nine months, whatever takes.
 Then we ask the question, what if you do all of this, what does life look like?
 Oh, gosh.
 Completely different than what it is.
 What's so funny is, you know, people that come through next level of life.
 We're in a season now where we've been doing this so long that we've got people coming back
 for a second next level of life.
 We've got people coming back again for another strat plan for their business.
 Why?
 Because they know it's going to be painful.
 It's going to hurt like hell.
 But once I get through that assess and fix the problems,
 it's going to be better than it was before.
 And so stop shying away.
 Get in there.
 Do the hard work of assessing and fixing the problems so that your life can be better than it is.
 It's worth the pain to get to that gain.
 Yeah, exactly.
 Look at that.
 Oh, it didn't know it.
 All right, folks.
 Just for you.
 Well, we have had fun on this show.
 Oh, I know this is the, it has been this is tough.
 This is what we love.
 This is why we talk about these things.
 Believe me, Brian, I can talk about a whole lot of other things.
 Usually movie quotes.
 Cars, why movie quotes.
 Cars, why in food.
 There's all kinds of stuff we can talk about.
 We do this as a passion of ours because we want to help.
 We want to change as many as we possibly can.
 Do a safavor.
 Go rank us.
 Go quote us.
 Quotus.
 Quotus.
 I don't think that's Quotus, right?
 Go leave a quote.
