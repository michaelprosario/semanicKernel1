 Welcome to the Chris LaCardau Show, where we discuss leadership and life and discover that business is what you do, not who you are.

 Welcome to the show, folks.
 We hope that you are having a phenomenal day.
 Today we are going to talk about the elephant in the room.
 Now, we hear all the time about fear of failure.
 We talk about it all the time.
 That is one of the things that we discover often here, whether it's in life,
 leadership or business, we're always seeing this fear of failure.
 Everybody knows people fear failure and we talk about it a lot.
 But we don't talk often about the fear of success.
 Now, you may hear that in a friend of mine, Claire Diaz Ortiz, had me on her work by design
 summit. She is phenomenal, lover, great, amazing.
 And as she's interviewing me on this summit that she's doing with all these leaders,
 we were talking about some things and I hit this part about the fear of success and she goes,
 yeah, but that's not real is it.
 And I say, well, it's interesting because you come from a strong family,
 phenomenal family, always pushed you to succeed, always helped you to get there.
 So fear of success is not even something you think about.
 That's a particular person who actually comes from a family that every time they try and get ahead,
 every time they try and do something successful, they're shot down.
 Or they're told, there's never going to work.
 Or they're told, well, don't get used to that.
 Or they hear all of these things telling them that they're not deserving of that success,
 that their success is going to be short lived and just constantly get the win yanked out of their cells.
 That is not Claire.
 That's not how she grew up.
 Hearing that concept of fear of success was actually surprising and once I explained it out, she was like, man,
 that makes sense. I can see that.
 So here are three questions that will probably help you confirm that you don't just fear failure,
 but success as well.
 So question number one, have you ever felt like pure joy or happiness?
 And then the next moment or a little while later, a sense of panic or anxiety of losing that very feeling.
 Or there ever things that are going really well in your life and you just start wondering,
 what is it going to go wrong?
 What is the next shoe going to drop?
 Or do you find yourself wandering down the what if paths or thinking of worst case scenarios?
 What if this happens?
 What if what if this? Well, if this happens, then of course, that means that this wasn't that successful,
 whatever that is.
 If you've ever felt anything even remotely close to either one of those three questions, well, then maybe you're constantly trying to plan and control your life.
 And you believe that if you work hard enough or know all the answers, you can prevent bad stuff from happening to you or your family or your business.
 Folks, I gotta tell you, it's exhausting and it keeps us from experiencing joy and deep peace.
 Now, we talk about fear of failure openly as a culture, but what about fear of success?
 And I will tell you this for the person that is not afraid of failure.
 The thing I say all the time is being afraid to fail is like being afraid to go to school to learn because failure is a great teacher for the person who's ready to receive it.
 But if you have a culture of fear of failure or fear of success, I guess what?
 It is absolutely draining you and keeping you from experiencing great joy.
 So, a lot of times it's called different things, but it's all the same for voting joy, fear of success, or even upper limit problem.
 The brainer brown puts it, joy is the most vulnerable emotion we experience. And if you cannot tolerate joy, what you do is start dressing, dressing tragedy.
 Now, dressing tragedy, she explains, is imagining something bad is going to happen when in reality nothing is wrong.
 I think every single person listening to this right now has experienced that in a lot of you have experienced a ton of it.
 So, how fear of success negatively affects us? We live in a state of stress or a fodder flight.
 We can't selectively shut down when we try to avoid loss or shut it down, we also shut down our ability to truly enjoy and feel.
 We self sabotage. We start creating conflict or picking fights. I know none of you have ever experienced that ever.
 We start with drawing from people or things that we absolutely love. We start dropping the ball at work.
 We become incredibly self-protective. We start feeling burned out by trying to keep all the plates spinning and all the bad things from happening that really aren't happening yet, right?
 We make it physically sick. We also start numbing with things like TV, social media, alcohol. There's all kinds of ways that we numb.
 We might numb with attacking other people. We might numb with isolation. There's so many different things that we do.
 We call those the surface level responses in the next level of life to numb from this process because we're self sabotaging. Think about this.
 I want you to hear the craziness behind this. And I also want you to hear, you're not alone. So many people experience this. We just don't talk about it. We just don't share it.
 We don't talk about it with other people who go and you know what? I had this great day the other day and it was phenomenal.
 And then so that it didn't turn into tragedy. I caused it to be a problem myself. I started preparing myself for the other shoe to drop and that great thing to go away.
 How to great sales call and you know, had it made a big sale and I was on cloud nine and then I yanked myself back down because you know, I was just expecting something bad to go happen.
 I had a great day with the family and things are great, but then you know what I screwed things up because I was just waiting for something to go wrong.
 We don't talk about that stuff. Now we do all the time in the next level of life because it comes up almost every single event.
 So it's not uncommon for us to do things like numb from it. We don't feel safe enough to talk about it to people we know. We don't know how to find the right person to talk to.
 You know, a lot of folks have not made it through the next level of life. So instead we choose these other areas to numb.
 Now a bigger problem with this is it's actually cyclical. It's something that becomes a cycle that we get stuck in.
 It's something that we're not working with. It's something that we're not working with.
 We don't understand what we're not working with.
