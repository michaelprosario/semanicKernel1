 I think that is what we are doing. I think that is what we are doing. I think that is what we are doing. I think that is what we are doing.
 I think that is what we are doing. I think that is what we are doing. If I am not aware of what I am feeling and what is going on inside of me and get out of my own head and you mentioned a minute ago about being healthier unhealthy and what are those responses look like and we are going to get into that.
 I have to understand myself and be aware. Some of that factors into maturity and healthy but really the underlying thing here today is self awareness so that we can be in a position to manage that stress better and a healthy way and help others which is where we are going to go.
 Absolutely. Three major things we want to teach on this episode is one. Realize what stress is. We talked about this during the next level leadership live event. Heather taught us in her lesson and teaching what exactly stress is how the body responds all that kind of stuff.
 Interestingly there are a lot of people who don't recognize that they have stress or that they experienced stress. In truthfully we all do. Stress is a body's response.
 Our body responds to things. We have the sympathetic nervous system, the pair sympathetic nervous system. Our body responds to stress by saying, "I have to either create things because something is stressful right now or I have to not be in a stressful mode."
 I'm just going to simplify this very easily and say we have situations where stress is not all stress is bad.
 We have times where we need a little bit of stress because it's pushing our body to accomplish something.
 Maybe it's during exercise or maybe it's during a stressful situation. Then we have heavy levels of stress which would be that fight or flight mode.
 I would stay and focus on this thing or get my body out of here because this is overwhelming.
 Then we have the opposite of that which would be considered like the rest and digest where the body can settle down and say, "Okay, we're not experiencing stress right now. We don't have to focus on this.
 We can just continue to rest, repair, rejuvenate the body."
 I think so much of what we want to take out of this season. If folks are listening or watching and are thinking, "I don't know what they're talking about. Why is anybody stressed right now?"
 I think there's nothing stressed about that.
 That is such an enviable position. Maybe they've been in the mountains and disconnected from the world.
 Most of us are feeling something, even if it's not registering. I'm thinking without stress, we can't grow.
 Growth comes from responding to challenges to being under some kind of pressure, whether it's self-inflicted or enforced or responding and learning how to respond in a healthy way.
 The idea is that self-awareness can take us to a healthier place. We can actually come out of this season that we're in. Let's hope it's just a limited season.
 We can come out of this so much better and so much equipped, well equipped to and prepared to respond to stress better later on.
 If we'll use this training season. That's one of the things we teach a lot, especially in the next level of life.
 Folks look at a lot of stressful situations in their life and they go, "Oh my gosh, this is so horrible. This is so bad. Look at these bad times. I've experienced.
 Look at this bad junk." What we teach, whether you're a believer or not.
 When I say believer, believer in Christ, stress causes growth one way or another. I always say that it's helpful if you actually utilize it.
 The opportunities there. If you take the stressful situation and turn it into something good that's fantastic.
 What we discover next level of life is so many of the heavy stress or good stress situations actually creates a lot of our character.
 It creates decision making. Sometimes it creates good decision making. Sometimes it creates crappy decision making.
 But either way we grow from it.
 Let me just toggle off for that for a second because so much of our poor decision making comes out of responding to stress or stressful situations in a poor way.
 In an unhealthy way or an immature way. Hopefully some of the skillset that we're developing right now is learning to manage that, not just cope but grow through that.
 So that we can still make good decisions.
 Right now it is so critical. Whether you're a business owner or you're a parent and a family situation, you're making financial decisions.
 There's all these different kinds of decisions that are being made right now in this season under pressure.
 And how we respond to that is critical. It's crucial.
