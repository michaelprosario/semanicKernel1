 What does forgiveness mean and not mean?
 And how to forgive yourself right after this?
 Welcome to the Crystal Cardo Show,
 where we discuss leadership and life
 and discover that business is what you do, not who you are.
 Welcome to the show, folks.
 I hope you're having a fabulous day wherever you are.
 Today on the show, I've got the amazing,
 what have I said about you guys that I can throw in right now?
 I need something fun and fabulous, the...
 Oh, oh, so many things.
 Oh, so the exuberant, the tenacious, I don't know, I got nothing.
 Joining me again on the show is Joel Forner and Brian Alex.
 Welcome, guys. Good to have you back on.
 Good to be here. Thank you.
 And we are hitting another three rules today.
 Today we are going to be talking about the three rules
 of forgiveness, of really forgiving others and yourself as well.
 And so we just see that this has been a fabulous series
 of being able to run through as Brian is continually trying to get us to disagree.
 You're going to hit some topic at some point.
 Is that what this is about to you?
 I think that's what I'm about to get.
 Give me a touch.
 I just want to find you guys to be, you know, but seriously, the great episodes
 I feel like and everybody has responded to that putting these series together
 and just diving in and saying, you know, what are these rules?
 Do these apply? Do they go well?
 And if not, why not? And if so, what works about them?
 So Brian, take it away from there.
 So I feel like we're in the, you know, not high school.
 This is more junior high, playground, elementary playground.
 Fight, fight, fight.
 We're just trying to say you guys up to disagree on something.
 Because it's entertaining.
 This is for entertainment value only.
 No, okay, so today, yeah, we're doing another three rules, but it has been fun.
 It is fun.
 I love the interaction that we've got here.
 And so today, talking about forgiving others, you know, maybe it really doesn't
 register in people's minds sometimes, but unforgiveness and the toxic residue of bitterness
 can be something like a cancer of the soul that eats away at someone's heart and mind.
 Perhaps they're not even aware of it, but whether it's that little grudge against the coffee
 barista who didn't say hello with a perky smile last time, or somebody who is, you know,
 verbally or even worse, physically assaulted you, we tend to keep these little records of
 wrongs and our hearts and minds.
 And usually they have no expiration date.
 They are permanent records.
 And so, you know, a question for you guys, before we get into the rules is just, how often
 do we see this crop up in root systems that are just plagued with the weed of unforgiveness?
 Oh, gosh, there's a ton.
 All this, I mean, in what, can we gosh Chris, almost probably nearly every next double life
 event, every one we coach and counsel to any level of depth when we start, especially getting
 into relationships, upbringing, how a friend, wrong, the things that people just aren't
 passed for various reasons, comes up all the time.
 Yeah, it's interesting.
 It's actually sad, incredibly sad, but I feel like we're seeing a heck of a lot more of this.
 I literally, I never listened to the radio.
 I mean, it's just a very rare occurrence, but the other day I jumped in my truck and I didn't
 have normally I'll plug in my phone, listen to the podcast, listen to a book, something
 like that, or just jammed to some great 70s music.
 And I hit the radio and it went to the DJ, I don't know if you still call it DJs or
 I don't know.
 And he was talking about, he goes, an amazingly wrong response happened in Florida today.
 A man who was golfing, another man was walking his dog on the golf course and the man who
 was golfing pulled out his gun because you should have a gun on the golf course, shot
 him and then proceeded to beat him up.
 And I'm telling you, it is there are so many things that we are seeing nowadays that that
 response, I mean, I would love to say that that absolutely shocked the daylight's out of me.
 But unfortunately, it didn't.
 We are seeing a lot of responses nowadays where I've had multiple people that I'm talking to
 and then one instance that showed up online of like parents beating each other up at children's
 baseball game or football game or something like that.
 I think there is this level of tension that is building and people that is just going ballistic.
 Throw into that past hurts, past wounds, whether or not it's an actual wound or you have
 victim mentality, it really actually doesn't matter, right?
 The result is the same.
 If you're holding on to it, let's say somebody did actually hurt you and you're holding
 on to it.
 Well, there's an old saying, it's bitterness is like taking a cyanide pill and hoping the other
 person dies.
 Holding on to that bitterness is actually just poisoning you, right?
 And I think now what we're seeing is a lot of people responding with that bitterness that
 they've been stockpiling inside.
 So yeah, we see it a lot.
 We see the greatest, nicest, sweetest people can have struggle in letting go of some things that have
 happened to them.
 So yeah, that's a long answer to that, but yes, we do see it a lot.
 Yeah, the sweetest people have always had a problem for giving.
 All right, you said this.
 You've never really landed.
 That's a great one.
 That's sweetest people.
 Okay, anyway, if you have to explain it, yeah, jokes are all moving right along.
 So yeah, if you're sweetest, please don't write us hate mail or yeah, I was sending it to
 Chris.
 That's good.
 Okay, if you do, you're native fun.
 Moving along.
 But you know, trying to kind of get under the surface here before we come around to the three
 rules, which are super practical.
 But you know, I just want to make a couple of comments about the human condition because
 it, we, we cry out for fairness, for justice, for good or in our, our minds right to prevail.
 At least as far as when we perceive ourselves to be the victim and not the perpetrator.
 Right.
 So as soon as something unsavory happens to us, we think in terms of revenge, retaliation, reciprocity,
 but it's, it's not always possible, you know, said to say, much to our sugar in, to, to
 return that, to hurt others, how we perceive that they've harmed us.
 And so what do we do?
 We harbor that unforgiveness.
 And so there's this, you know, there's this idea that we want things to be fair and right
 in order, accept when it's our turn, accept when we're the victim.
 And this, you know, I'm sure this is going to come out in some of these rules, the whole
 victim mentality thing here, but the resulting effect is, you know, it can, it can have really
 serious damage to us physically, mentally, emotionally, depression, you know, PTSD, other
 health conditions.
 And, you know, and this can be compounded even more when the person that you're having trouble
 for giving is yourself.
 And so let me just pause there for a second.
 How much does that come up?
 100%.
 I don't think there's ever a time that you find somebody who is completely forgiven themselves
 for every bad situation, bad mistake, bad decision that they've made.
 I think, you know, that we are, we are just so used to beating ourselves up.
 Now it's not to say that some aren't into Nile, but it still doesn't, you know, that's
 still not saying that they don't beat themselves up for something, you know, there's some
 level of negative self-talk.
 I mean, imagine the mind that completely forgave themselves for every single thing.
 I mean, it would just be phenomenal.
 How good would they be at forgiving others, you know, who's syndicates them?
 Yes, the minds trying to forgive each other.
 Sorry, there's a delay over here.
 I'm in, I'm on the other side of the planet.
 And there's a bit of a delay.
 And so I'm hearing things that maybe you're not saying, I don't know.
 Anyway, forgive me.
 How do minds forgive?
 I mean, it's all, it's just, you know.
 All right, well, if only everybody can see Joel right now, that's fantastic.
 Coming up next, the rules that you need to follow in order to truly forgive others and
 yourself.
 Freedom, it's so powerful.
 I don't rejuvenate and almost renewed.
 I just felt so welcomed and loved and accepted for who I am and not an ounce of judgment.
 So I was very comfortable there.
 That had a really big impact on me.
 It's going to be worth it.
 It's going to be hard.
 But it's going to be even better on the other side.
 For me, it was just very refreshing.
 And I want to say life to you for me, it really was.
 You know, I would go to the next level of life again and probably again and probably again.
 Because it's so powerful.
 If you want to experience the same kind of life transformation, the same kind of self-awareness
 and freedom that they have, or maybe you're just curious what the process would look like
 for you, then head on over to crsacrido.com/nexlevellife.
 Alright, well, welcome back, everybody.
 And here we go.
 You know how we play the game.
 I'm going to read a rule and it's associated rationale.
 And then one of you lucky gentlemen will get to kick it off within immediate reaction.
 Maybe you hate the rule of it, whatever doesn't matter, just modify it, fit your own perspective
 and experience.
 The other person gets to weigh in either green or disagreeing.
 The more disagreement, of course, the more entertaining and hopefully informative.
 That's the point.
 The point is that the listener takes away from all of this ideation and deliberation, a greater
 perspective.
 So everybody ready?
 Ready?
 We have a lot of forgiveness.
 It feels like who's lying is that anyways.
 The more you disagree, the more points you get, the points don't matter.
 Exactly.
 Alright, here we go.
 Let's kick it off.
 Rule number one.
 And I'm going to, you know, I have my rare moments where I try, I try to be a little bit vulnerable.
 I'm going to try to be vulnerable as a way of digging a little bit underneath the surface
 a little more today.
 Go get my popcorn.
 Hopefully get a Chris loves it when Brian's vulnerable.
 I must break you.
 Alright, here we go.
 So rule number one, I put it like this.
 Objectively assess the infraction for what it actually is.
 And here's my, here's my, my vulnerability moment.
 I'm guilty.
 I am guilty of imagining a lot of what actually plex me.
 And so, I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 I'm not going to be a bit too much.
 That's the first rule. What do we think?
 Absolutely. It's one of those things where it is so difficult to get people.
 It just seems like it's getting tougher sometimes.
 It's so difficult for to get people to ask that very question.
 Were you hurt?
 Did you know by Joel asking how was your day?
 Did he hurt you?
 It's funny to you.
 He did.

 If you go down the path of assuming the best, which we don't do anymore, I mean it's like

 I'm assuming that he meant something by it because I'm struggling or I'm losing more.
 I'm whatever the thing is, okay, well, what's the truth?
 The truth is I have no clue if he meant anything other than good morning.
 So let me just assume all he meant was good morning.
 Here's the great thing.
 If you're wrong and he did mean something by it.
 Here's what I can promise you.
 He's coming back for another pass.
 There's going to be another opportunity.
 If somebody is throwing out a bar or if somebody is being passive aggressive and you don't receive it, there's a high probability they're coming back with another pass.
 So many times what I'll do, especially in like something like next level.
 I'll just go with it.
 You know, just assume that they didn't mean anything.
 And then I'll just I'll wait and watch.
 So especially like somebody, if somebody's like a high regulatory in their values and their motivators.
 If you don't know values, you know, that's one of the things we teach along with disc personality profiles.
 It's the things that motivate you the things that you value.
 And one of those is high regulatory.
 Somebody who loves systems, processes, all kind of stuff.
 That can be the person that holds onto an offense for years.
 I mean years and throw barbs later on only to find out later.
 Oh, that's not what that meant. Oh, it's not.
 And then immediately just drop it.
 Now they no longer care about it, but they could have held onto it for five years, right?
 So if you're wrong and you approach it as though everything is
 Copicotic.
 I mean, he didn't do anything ridiculous.
 He's just saying good morning.
 And you don't give that person if that person's being passive aggressive if they're trying to get a message across and you do not receive their message.
 I will lay down money.
 They're coming back with another pass.
 They're going to come back and say something else.
 If they do, this gives you a great opportunity to then gain perspective.
 I don't think you need the gain perspective on the first time.
 Just assume that they didn't mean anything by it.
 Just rock on have a great day.
 But let's say they come back for another pass.
 Then that gives you the opportunity to go, hey, how can I understand that?
 It appears as though you're throwing a barb in my direction.
 I'm experiencing that comment as a barb.
 Is there something in there?
 And then you get to open up that discussion and see what's going on behind it?
 But when you automatically receive everything or almost everything or even a lot of things as they're being something behind it, you have to start asking a very important question.
 Why?
 Why do I see it that way?
 Why am I receiving it that way?
 And here's one of the things.
 And Joel, you know, I don't know if we've ever actually talked about this.
 But one of the things I see a lot is many times people are projecting onto somebody else something that they might do.
 So if it's, if I'm the person who's going to step in and I would say to you, good morning and I mean something behind it,
 then when you say good morning, I'm going to assume there's something behind it.
 We see this all the time. I see this all the time. I'm sure Joel does too.
 Where the thing, it's always dependent upon the person, right?
 If somebody wants to hurt somebody with a,
 Oh, I don't know, making a joke about their birthday.
 And then somebody says something about their birthday.
 Well, because it's the way that they would do it, they meant something by it.
 You know, whatever that thing is, however, they would do something, they see it coming and it's like, well, I would do that.
 So you must be doing that. I can't tell you how many times in my life it is a new mr.
 But somebody has accused me of something again. This is what I do for a living.
 So it's not, you know, that uncommon, but I'm talking about in just in life in general with people I love and no.
 Somebody will say something I accused me of something and I'm like, what in the world are you talking about only to find out?
 And as I'll leave them through the process, what we'll find out is it's usually something that they would do themselves.
 Joel, that's your opportunity to disagree with everything that Chris just said.
 So yeah, we're not to the entertainment value yet, then.
 Everyone, I agree with the rule and I agree with that as well. I mean, it's, it's amazing how powerful fear and assumptions are in these situations.
 Because the rule, what I'm receiving the rule, Brian, is this is just normal kind of relational.
 This isn't an obvious someone walked up and punched you in the nose and it's like, yes, I know that actually hurt me.
 This is more day today communication related stuff between people.
 But it's amazing. I think to the extent that we're more fearful, and to the extent we make a lot of assumptions, we put ourselves in this situation of being hurt when there was no intent perhaps behind something, no one meant to hurt you.
 But if you're, I mean, I think, I mean, of course, worth plays in immensely here too because if these situations where, you know, you're finding a tremendous amount of worth in
 your spouse's opinion, your leaders opinion, your team members opinion, your parents opinion that you can receive information.
 And because of there's a fear of being rejected, there's a fear of judgment.
 You've got a lot of history with someone. So you think you know their patterns and you know, I'll know what that meant, that kind of stuff.
 And you set your own reality based on assumptions or lie driven fear in that that you immediately box yourself in.
 And you box yourself in, you set your own reality, which is the opposite of gaining perspective because in your so focused on self in those moments.
 Well, what just happened to me, rather than watching the other person is stopping and thinking, I wonder what that was.
 I wonder what they meant by that. I wonder what that tone means. I wonder what those words mean. That actually triggered me. I immediately felt an emotion.
 And we can take that so personally when all this worth stuff, fear stuff, assumption stuff is going on in our brains and these all these force of habit responses we can have.
 That immediately causes us to focus all on self rather than gaining perspective and really being able to practice this things that Chris was just saying.
 And then being like, okay, was that really am I really hurt going back to the rule was I really hurt or was that me.
 I'll tell you most of the time, it's me.
 It's not the other person. It's me. It's stuff that I struggle with that I'm triggered in the moment.
 And the thing to practice as a take away from all this information is to ask yourself this very question is was that,
 that number was that me. And why do I feel this way right now?
 The information just came and talking with my spouse, you know, make up an example.
 I don't know, talking to somebody today and I felt the physical response, the emotional response.
 The key is a key is to turn in and ask why am I struggling right now in this conversation? Why am I feeling this way?
 Why is that stress response that out of control response that I feel hurt response?
 Start with you. Why are you feeling that way? And what is it that came through your brain so quickly? Like, what did you tell yourself?
 And what assumptions did you make? And that'll start moving you down a much better path.
 Yeah, I love that. I love that you know part of what we do part of what you guys do.
 What do you mean something special that you love Joel's answer and you didn't love mine?
 Are you trying to understand?
 You received that.
 I see what the right answer.
 But what you guys doing, what we do as a team on a, you know, at large, let's say is, is we elevate someone's self perception,
 so that they can accurately assess and see themselves.
 And there's something, you know, so empowering about that. I'll say it conversely, we are powerless really to change until we see ourselves as we, as we really are.
 And just that self inventory, that self awareness, that perception, getting bigger is gaining strength and the ability to then do something about it.
 But we can't if we don't see that first.
 Yeah, let me, let me, let me agree and push back.
 It's not really pushing back on what you're saying.
 Oh, what? You're disagreeing with Brian.
 Yes, this is even better.
 Joel has the entertainment value. This is all for Joel's sake now.
 So I need to refray this because it's not really a disagreement. It's an addition to.
 And that is everything you said is correct. If, if, if, if, here's, here's the big key.
 If you want help.
 There are so many people who do not want help that they like staying where they are.
 They like, you know, the old phrase, misery, lost company is so very true that they don't want to actually change.
 So what you're saying is absolutely correct in the context of somebody who wants growth, who wants help, who wants adjusting.
 We have a smaller, most of our people do, but we have a small portion of people that are just like,
 No, you can't help me. No, you don't understand. No, I mean, it's just a whole litany of excuses.
 Even when you show them the great perspective, you just don't get it.
 You just don't understand. It's just everything not to change. And so that's the one that's the one addition I would put in there is that.
 And hopefully if somebody out there is listening to this and going, oh my gosh, that's me.
 I really don't want to change.
 Then hopefully they can go, what do I do about that if that makes sense?
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And just to underline again. I mean, we're talking about somebody who's that that self perception that sees it for themselves.
 You know, there's a final dawning revelation realization of their true state. And so, all right, I think we're ready to move on to rule number two.
 All right, here we go. Everybody ready ready to pounce ready to disagree. Here we go.
 Determine whether it can be changed, righted or fixed. All right, here's here's why this is some of the rationale behind I'm guilty of thinking well,
 I don't care if you know to someone who rock Joel told me good morning and asked me how my weekend what is so I don't care.
 I I loved to throw Joel or another bus. I don't know why he's just such a nice guy. It's just I don't know. Anyway, I don't care if you're sorry or not. I just don't want you to do it again.
 This is where this defense mechanism will will come in self protection fear as Joel mentioned a moment ago.
 All of that just goes right into play. If somebody's sorry or not, it doesn't really change my perspective of the situation. I just wanted to happen again.
 And there's that, you know, victim and defense that comes in.
 And you know, what I what I love again about what we do here. We kind of we tease and we kind of talk about in different context from different angles.
 The you know lines from the serenity prayer or 12 step or Victor Frankle or our stoic philosophy or biblical theology. All of that kind of comes to bear about determining what you can change and what you can't about your situation.
 And being very clear about where we have control over a situation or ourselves or response, for example, and you know, maybe you can't change the fact that something happened. You can't control or make right necessarily a past infraction, but you can play some healthy boundaries.
 And so, you know, after that first one objectively assessing what actually happened, then going on to step two determine whether it can be changed or right or what you need to do.
 What is the response now? That's kind of where my mind goes. How would you guys reframe that or disagree with that?
 It sounds like a good step to me, you know, Brian, to take that step. I mean, there may be situations where maybe not, but when it comes to, when it comes to relationship, especially if it's a close relationship, we're really after unity.
 I mean, think about a marriage or think about a close sibling or think about just someone close to you.
 And if you're in a relationship, then it's a great thing to do if everyone is willing to do that. Both people have to be willing to do that. I tend to think about these situations.
 And what's my bigger goal of a relationship is trying to maintain trust and trying to build unity and trying to take those measures to do that. But that's me. I want to be that way. I like to operate that way.
 I don't like their being like that distance or that. Like if we need to talk through these things, then let's talk through them.
 Yeah, I mean, it's what more is there to say, if you don't focus on fixing the problem, then what is that pointing out? That's just revealing that you actually like staying in the problem.
 Even if you don't have the right tool to fix the problem getting outside of yourself and seeking somebody something that can help you to solve it is actually not that terribly difficult.
 Even if it's just going and finding somebody who is healthy to present the situation to and discuss through, but not to do anything about it, not to fix, not to change, not to make any adjustments is just saying, I actually don't want to change.
 I'm aware of it, but I don't want to change.
 All right. Well guys, coming up next, the third rule you need to follow in order to finally forgive and move forward. That's after this.
 Folks, if you've been listening to me for any length of time, then you know the number one issue when it comes to business, when it comes to family, when it comes to friendships, is having a lack of high quality communication.
 To make sure that you are absolutely winning in every aspect of your life, it all starts with having great communication.
 The best way to get that communication is to understand your personality style and to understand the personality style of the folks that you're spending the most time with, whether it be at work, whether it be at home.
 The best way to do that is to go to Chrissacrittle.com/store and get your personality profile and personality profiles for your team to day.
 Get it for your family members. Today, as you go through that profile, you will begin to see the greatest ways to communicate.
 Go to Chrissacrittle.com/store today.
 And welcome back. Here we are. And we've gone through two rules. We have.
 Joel is always vying for unity and while I appreciate that. I was hoping for more entertainment today. Here we are in the third rule.
 We have no disagreements so far. A little bit of pushback from Chris always directed towards me. I'm not going to take that the wrong way.
 I choose to forgive him move on. I'm going to apply these rules.
 It was passive of a girl.
 Rule number three.
 You were more aggressive than passive, but okay.
 I'm a aggressive.
 You know.
 All right. Rule number three is release the other person for your own health.
 Release the other person for your own health.
 Here's the rationale. We tend to keep the other person prisoner.
 It's like we're holding them. And this is another Brian vulnerability moment.
 We're holding them hostage until they pay what we think they owe us for the infraction.
 Whatever perceived or imagined or real infraction that there was.
 But real life doesn't work like that.
 And it doesn't in the sense of we are the ones being held hostage, not them.
 And it's like Chris you mentioned a moment ago about you know unforgiveness is you drinking poison and waiting for that other person to die.
 Well, you know, and just to press because we want to get in this third rule here.
 We want to get a little bit more personal.
 What if you're the one?
 What if you are the one that you can't forgive?
 You're holding yourself.
 You're taking poison and you're dying and you know it's easy to see how unhealthy that is.
 But you know are there situations where we can't or we don't release the other person?
 So let's kick that off. Here's the rule.
 Release the other person for your own health.
 Is that always possible?
 Yeah. So I'm going to go all kind of God on you here because I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 That's where we're going.
 We're just going all God right here.
 So it is as a person who has done that somewhere around four billion times maybe it's more like five billion.
 It is foolishness to not let go of you know to release the other person in the situation.
 Now as I say that there are tons of people listening to this that are going,
 whoa, hold on a second.
 What are you talking about? And here's the reason why I say this prayer all the time the Lord's prayer.
 And there's something that our Lord put in there to help me remember that I have sinned against him a good Jillian times.
 That's the highest number. I know how to know any bigger numbers in that.
 So I have done so much stupid and praise God.
 I've got to God that if I keep moving in his direction, then you know, I have all this forgiveness.
 There's a kingdom of forgiveness waiting for me right?
 Who says essentially this, if you want me to forgive you,
 well what are you going to do about forgiving my other kids that have done stupid?
 So I think it's so funny with that we don't, we know we look at what God has done for us.
 We look at what Yeshua, our Lord and Savior did on the cross for us.
 And we can see that we are sinful creatures and praise God he did it.
 But it's almost as if we forget that he's doing it for the person who's sinning against us.
 And we rarely ever put ourselves in the shoes of the one who's sinning against somebody else.
 We rarely take that responsibility and think, oh my gosh, I'm doing this to you.
 Man, I hope you release me.
 I hope you're not holding on to bitterness.
 I have to think about for me, grace is such a massive thing.
 I've been given so much grace. I must give grace.
 You know, I hope that people aren't holding on to, I've done stupid.
 I've hurt people. I've jacked things up. I've sinned up.
 I've messed things up. I mean, it's just, I have no problem.
 At this point of my life, now I did the first half of my life.
 You know, just like most people still. I say this and a lot of people go, oh, I couldn't say what he just said.
 I don't have a problem recognizing that I am a sinful creature and need of great salvation and grace and mercy and love, right?
 And the reason why I'm able to say that is because I don't hide behind it.
 You know, when we convince ourselves that maybe we haven't done as bad, we struggle in hiding.
 You know, I don't want to look at the sins. It's so funny. There's things that we go through in next level.
 For somebody's like, oh, I don't want to look at that anymore. It's like, no, no, no.
 It's okay to look at it. It's okay to go. That's no longer me. I'm moving in this direction.
 I'm fixing things. I'm changing things.
 So to hold on to ought against your brother to not forgive the person who is sending, oh, because you don't understand how badly they send it. Oh my gosh.
 How badly I've sent against God has way outwayed any single individual sending against me.
 Right? So if my God is big enough to forgive me, then I have got to recognize, you know, I want to stand before him and go, thank you for your forgiveness.
 Thank you for allowing me to be a part of this kingdom, right?
 And I hate the thought of standing before him and going, how come you haven't forgiven these 700 people who've sent against you?
 Oh, crud, you know, so it's like the parable of the man who gets forgiven by the king, his debt, which is massive that, you know, he cannot possibly pay.
 And once he's forgiven, he goes outside in the guy who owes him two bucks, he has him thrown in jail.
 Right? We can't be that person. We've got to be the person who recognizes what has been done for all of our sin.
 And we have to be somebody who's able to let go of others.
 Yeah, I love what you bring, what you bring up there, Chris, because it's interesting when you read through the Bible, like in the Lord's prayer and off through the Bible that we look at.
 How is God want us to mirror him? He doesn't, it's he's, look at look at what I've done for you.
 But I'm trying to get you to be that way too. I'm a shepherd, you're a shepherd. I'm a forgiveer, you be a forgiveer. I give mercy, you give mercy. I'm sacrificial, you be sacrificial.
 He wants to create himself within us. He wants us to look like his son, not just receive everything and being praised God.
 I'm going to receive that grace. Now it's a, hey, be graceful. Don't just sit there idle, receiving it, be that.
 And then that's a lot of the true tests, but I think as we walk those things out, it helps us really see what we've been given as well.
 Especially when we in our humanity and our flesh can experience difficulty with it. Like men, those situations where it's like, I don't want to forgive this person.
 It feels better right now in this moment to be angry. It feels wrong to forgive or it's those situations where if I forgive, it goes against the thought of, I want, I want them to experience pain. I want them to, I want them to know what they did. I want them to feel what they did. I want them to experience these super tough consequences.
 I will say that there's a lot when we experience those emotions and those thoughts.
 That's the work we need to do on ourselves. And this is where the word practice really comes into play is that we have to practice being forgiving. We have to practice being graceful.
 Because God is just that way. We are not that way, most of us, generally speaking.
 We have to practice building up that muscle and cooperating with the Holy Spirit to actually be that person that God wants us to be.
 There are so many situations in life where I can think about it. Just a daily communication with somebody to big things that have happened in my life to me.
 And I can think about those times when I have that negative response. But now I'm practicing trying to move in this direction of you need to forgive.
 You need to be graceful because you know what this is going to do inside of you. You know this builds up that bitterness and that resentment.
 And then what place do you stay in a emotionally? You're frustrated, you're angry. It's like why do we want to choose just to stay in that place?
 And a lot of it's because it's I want that person to have what's coming to them.
 I want to put them in time out and hold myself back from them because I'm mad at them. And I want them to know that.
 Now let's say look at what we're doing with the relationship. We're moving in the wrong direction. We're now making what I would say are wrong decisions.
 We're not trying to mend. We're not trying to create unity. We're not trying to fix something.
 Knowing it's probably only going to stay quote unquote fixed for us so long and we're going to have to do this again.
 It's kind of reminds me of my relationship with God. It's like here's grace and then here's sin again and here's again. Now I'm good again. Oh and here's sin again. And here I go.
 Just living out what Paul say. I do the things I don't want to do.
 And I need that grace and forgiveness. So when we can walk in those shoes, I hope that it moves all of a sudden in direction of man. I've got to practice being that way and not harboring up these negative emotions.
 All right folks, well, I hope this has helped you today. I hope that next time we can deliver a little bit more entertainment quality.
