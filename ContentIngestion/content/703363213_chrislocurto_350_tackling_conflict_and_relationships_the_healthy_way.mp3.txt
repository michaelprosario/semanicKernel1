 Welcome to the Chris LaCordo Show, where we discuss leadership and life and discover that business is what you do, not who you are.
 [Music]
 Welcome to the show folks. Today we are going to be talking about how to find more purpose,
 contentment and peace in your life. I know none of you actually out there want that, but we're going to be talking about that.
 So some people seek out life change when they're in a really tough spot or they're going through a difficult life event that's turned their world upside down.
 Some people look for personal growth when they're tired of feeling stuck and a rut or dealing with the same issues for years.
 And the funny thing is, is sometimes we don't recognize early on that we are getting into a rut of dealing with the same issues.
 And some people, they're not looking for life change, but they have a good life.
 What they end up finding transformation anyway. Our guest today is a husband, a father and a business owner,
 with over 20 years of experience. Matt Fensky is passionate about helping others. He continually challenges his family and his team members
 and helping his team get out of their comfort zone to see what is possible in their lives.
 So welcome to the show, Matt.
 Thank you for having me, Chris.
 Dude, it's good having you on, especially after all that we've worked through through Strat Plan next level.
 I fall that fun stuff. So it's good to have you on the show.
 I'm glad to be here looking forward to it.
 So tell folks who you are.
 They don't, you know, a lot of folks don't know who you are. So tell them a little bit about you.
 Your family, your career, anything that I may have left out.
 Yeah, I'm 40, which makes me think that if I'm with average, if I put them play by the average,
 I just hear my life's probably half over here on earth.
 But I'm grateful that I have eternity to look forward to. I am married.
 Actually, married my, we joke about it. We weren't dating at this time, but we did go to preschool together.
 So I married to my preschool as we heard.
 We two kids, they're 16 and 13, a son and a daughter.
 And I have had the unique experience, basically, and almost all of my adult working life of being part of the same
 organization here, and then ownership. So again, as we said, over 20 years experience here.
 I have to go back to the preschool sweetheart. Do you guys actually remember each other from preschool?
 I would say vaguely. And thank you if my wife listens to this for trying to get me to trouble.
 Of course, you remember.
 You're seeing numbers that more vividly than I do.
 But we remember each other. We went to school, really to the same school, our entire lives.
 That's amazing. That is incredible. Well, I already prefaced that your life was great.
 So let's talk about finding that life change. How did you end up finding life change?
 You know, you talked a little bit in your intro about the various reasons that people want to work on things in life.
 And I think one of the things that has happened to me over the years is I've always entered this place and multiple times where I felt stuck.
 Stuck in how I could move forward. It could be something as simple as hey, I want to move forward in my career or it could be something like I'm just stuck.
 And I have no idea what I'm supposed to do next.
 I have not always looked at that as an opportunity. Now it's clear to me with hindsight that those were opportunities in life.
 And now the thing that I've learned is that I do not have to run into those solid brick walls that I ran into in the past.
 To be aware of that things may be off and I need to be a little more self reflective and aware. And that's what's got me to this point.
 It's so funny you talk about those brick walls because you're high DI, high ID. I think so many times many high D's believe that the brick walls are actually what they're looking for.
 You know, if you can find a brick wall and blast through it, then you're doing something right. Is that sound familiar?
 Yes, and could I take a more to speak to the high D's that listen to this.
 Oh yeah. That is not true. I'll seem to think that that is that is truth.
 That there's some sort of energy or fun or challenge that comes out of that. And I cannot deny that those emotions can exist in those moments.
 But I can say that there is a better way.
 It's like the old saying if you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
 You know, if you're if you're a high D and you relate to blasting through brick walls and there's some sort of good on the other side of it, you imagine that everything needs to be a brick wall.
 First you came through strap plan with your company crazy power for you guys. It was just such a fun event fun tough, but amazing event. Then you came through next level life.
 I brought that amazing preschool sweetheart through with you on that. And for those of you that aren't familiar with next level life, that's our two day one on one personal discovery event where we guide people
 Through a personalized process to help them at unstuck in life to improve their relationships to discover those things that are holding them back from freedom and peace.
 And that's one of the things that you you discovered was that getting unstuck before next level life. Did you think there was more?
 Like, did you think there was more personal growth? Did you think that maybe there was a better way to look at life for yourself?
 Certainly, I believe I went into next level life within over the mind and then the minute that we started with next level life. I sort of felt my mind closed there for a moment as you say Chris everybody's journey is different in those moments.
 But yeah, of course I thought there was more. But I think if I wouldn't have went to next level life, I would have been searching maybe in a little bit different direction and I don't think that would have been the right thing to do.
 In that direction of what we were seeking.
 Yeah, back to the what more can I do to create achievement, accomplishment and image of myself, all of those things that sort of create this false sense of math you are awesome.
 Crazy thing and we've talked about this since is are you still finding accomplishment in life and if so what's different about it?
 I'm still finding accomplishment. However, my son does put it best and I appreciate his honesty. He tells me I just asked him last night because I mentioned I was going to be on this podcast.
 Again, we've talked about this a lot but what do you notice has has changed and me if anything and his simple response was dead your more chill.
 And I think of all the things that have been said of all the things I've thought about myself since next level life that really does sum it up and more chill to me means a lot of different things and one of them is the world does not revolve around me.
 It is clear to me that putting others first is the right way to go and that is not a bad thing that does not harm me in any way.
 Those are some sort of the I think those are the weird thoughts that were going through my mind ahead of this this event that it was a it's either me or them and not so much of a hey this is a large interconnected world we live in and I think we've talked about it before it's that.
