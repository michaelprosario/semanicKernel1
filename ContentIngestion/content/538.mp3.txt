 Three big things you need to consider when trying to decide whether to go with that outside higher or
 Whether to promote from within that is coming up next
 Welcome to the Chris LaCredo Show where we discuss leadership and life and
 Discover that business is what you do not who you are
 Welcome to the show folks. I hope you're having a fabulous day wherever you are
 Today we are gonna have some fun talking about the three big considerations when deciding
 Between promoting within your organization and hiring someone from the outside
 So who is this for who am I actually talking to well
 Owners CEOs executives leadership teams absolutely HR
 Reps and recruiters anybody who is looking to hire right anybody who's looking to fill a role
 Now I can tell you this
 The next hire is one of the most important decisions that you'll make now for a lot of you out there you're probably like
 I really don't think so Chris we have a team of 200 people
 That's fine. That's great. You have a lot of folks on your team
 Guess what if you're not focused on getting the absolute right person in the seat
 If you're not focused on making sure that you're making the right moves strategically inside of the business
 Then
 It not being an important decision can absolutely start to
 Create what we call a shotgun approach in your business. It can start to create a
 Negative effect on your culture. It can start to create a negative effect on your communication. So as we go through this
 I don't want you to just think about oh these are three big things all these are all important
 It can make a massive difference on what happens inside of your culture
 It can make a massive difference on what happens with accountability
 I can tell you it can make an incredible difference on how much energy you're putting out on
 Training a team member right so yes if you've got two people 200 people 2000 people
 I think and most of the people listening to this you don't have 2000 team members you're you've got two team members
 to a couple hundred team members right
 So
 We're really not speaking to large businesses
 We're really speaking to small and medium sized businesses. This is an incredibly important decision now if it's not the most that's fine
 I get it understand but I can tell you it should be up there right and the process really should be up there
 So we have an elaborate and I don't mean complicated but I do mean comprehensive
 interviewing process it is a long process
 This is on purpose and for good reason right the team affects every aspect of the business again
 I just mentioned the culture above all your team affects your culture now for me
 What is culture? I say that culture is actions and attitudes
 Right and that is a big part of what's driving your business
 the number one issue we see in every single business is a lack of high levels of quality communication
 The number two issue is a lack of quality accountability and number three tends to win out being
 lack of quality culture so making sure you get the right people and the right seats is incredibly important to your culture
 It also affects your clients your customers it also affects the team members it absolutely affects your bottom line hello
 Every team member affects your bottom line one way shape before
 And we also understand that new hires are an investment into the business into the team and the culture and everything that we've just talked about
 So we've talked recently about how your client is the most valuable asset of your business go back and listen to episode
 533 rules to hedge against customer loss
 But let's quickly add this to the mix that your team is your most important
 Investment now chances are you're not somebody who's listening to the show and only thinks of your team as
 Just a way for you to get what you want right just you don't think every team is just numbers right so the people listening to the show
 I believe that statement
 Resonates right I don't think we have people listening that are going I really don't care about my team
 They're just they're just a way that I build a business right so if you're looking at it from the aspect of people matter
 Your team matters then your team is your most important investment right so
 Should you promote from within or go with that outside higher now?
 Let's assume that both types of candidates have the required talent right both internally and external
 candidates they they have the talent to pull off
 What the role needs this is you know something that's important as we go through these three steps with that being said
 There are times that we can absolutely train someone to have the talent you know
 Train that piece in if they're a great cultural fit, but that's not what we're talking about today
 All right we're we're comparing
 external and internal as
 Being somewhat equal as far as what it takes to pull off the role itself
 That's why these other three pieces are gonna make so much more sense so the other conversation is for another day
 You know can we train in the talent?
 That's a considerably different
 Conversation so let's look at the pros and cons the first thing to consider is number one
 Time and costs
 So internal hires will fast track the interview process now we're not talking about circumventing the interview process right
 But there are things like for us are very first interview is a culture interview
 Right it's a 15 minute 30 minute max conversation with somebody to see if they even fit the culture
 Well if you've already got somebody on your team you should already have that answered right the next one is going through a lot of the talents that they currently have
 You know the their resume what have they done all that you've already got certain steps covered with somebody who's already on your team now
 You do want to take a look at
 You know what have they done since they've been on your team that's gonna give them an advantage to being in this role that you know
 That shows you that they could pull off this role and execute the job descriptions the KRAs all that kind of fun stuff
 But they will they can absolutely fast track the interview process now if you promote from within you still have to fill
 their role
 After they've been promoted however
 This person can usually
 Help in the replacing of themselves as they already know what it takes to succeed in the place and or in that role that they've been in so it's it's it's great when you've got somebody
 Who and if you've given them the time to do so right let's not put them in a new role in
 100% slam them with the new role
 Let's allow them time to
 Retrain somebody or you know train somebody coming up into that role and help them to become successful and to
 Make them successful lead them to success in that role. We don't want to just
 dump another person in that role because we feel really good about moving this person to a new role
 We want to be able to set somebody up for success. We want them to delegate properly if you have been through killing the leadership crazy cycle
 Then you understand the importance of not just giving somebody role and then coming back and asking them did you do it yet
 Did you do it yet did you get that done? Oh you didn't oh okay I guess I'm gonna have to take that back
 Instead we want them delegated to
 properly
 So that the person moving into the new role can be successful as well
 So when we look at an external hire well they're gonna take a longer and they're gonna cost you more in this process right so if you bring in an outsider
 Then you should be prepared for a longer onboarding process because why I mean is that a bad thing? No
 Every external hire should go through a long
 a very comprehensive
 Hiring process and onboarding process. We want to set them up for success
 So you shouldn't be looking at your process and going while it's long. I guess
 Maybe Chris is saying I need to shorten it up. No that is not what I'm saying at all
 All I'm doing is comparing the two so if you bring somebody in from the outside
 They're gonna go through a much longer onboarding process and it could end up costing you a little more right
 But it could be worth it if it's the right person if you've got somebody who's better than anybody you have internally
 Then it's the right way to go so I don't want you to hear oh internal is way better
 Again
 Assuming that they have the same talents to pull off the roll then one of the benefits of hiring internally is that it's gonna cut down on time and most likely it's gonna cut down on expenses as well
 Now if you don't then for the love external is absolutely going to be the best way of bringing somebody in who has the right talent
 One of the other issues when it comes to time and in money with external hiring
 Is you may have to go through a lot of interviews before you find the person who does have the talent
 Once again, please do not hear me say internal is just better
 That is not what I'm saying
 What I'm saying is all things considered
 All things you know talent looking the same you're probably gonna spend less time
 You're probably gonna spend less money if you're hiring from within
 Because they're already a part of that process
 So what is the second thing we need to consider?
 Well the team impact this is a big one
 Internal hires have built in familiarity and
 Very possibly
 Not saying it it's an absolute but very possibly they've got loyalty across the team
 Right they're rapport with with others goes a long way
 It also helps again fast track the the integration among
 Existing teams or team members this could also boost the morale of other team members knowing that the loyalty is
 Rewarded so think about it if you promote somebody from within
 What does that communicate to all the other team members?
 Oh my gosh that's an opportunity
 I'm they chose somebody from within instead of just pulling somebody from the outside that's actually a great thing
 Who knows that might happen with me someday?
 So a great aspect is how it's going to impact the team now if you're doing a great job leading your culture
 Well, and if you're doing a great job with accountability and if you're doing a great job with communication
 If you're doing a great job making sure that you don't have unresolved conflict between team members
 If you're doing a great job leading your team and making them successful
 Then this should be a
 Fantastic advantage to the internal higher
 Because again the rapport the loyalty all of that
 Really goes a long long way a lot of team members are excited that somebody is moving into a role that they already know that they know how to work with
 They know how to communicate with if what you're finding is that you have got a team
 Backstabbers of gossipers of you know people who are don't communicate well don't have good accountability and
 You know they suck inside of the culture well then guess what this is probably this is this isn't going to have any great impact it
 It might actually have a more negative impact than bringing in somebody externally so
 Things to consider
 You know how will this person if I'm looking at an internal person how they're going to impact the team?
 What about the external higher the external higher well we're going to have to have time to train to
 acclimate to adapt to the existing culture this could
 Obviously present an unstable element in the culture because we're bringing in somebody new right but it could also
 It could also be the wrench on the machine it could be the thing that you want it could be the thing that you're looking to
 Change or shake things up a bit so many times you know I go back to days of
 Gosh decades ago of having a sales team that was really a I shouldn't say a sales team it was a customer service team that did sales
 But they could only sell so much and it was one of those times it's like guys we
 We're spending a lot of time on the phone we're spending a lot of time in conversations
 We have the tools to help people
 What's the struggle?
 Oh, this is the best we can do it's like a you know a ceiling and then bringing somebody and with this from the outside who just
 Blue it out of the water. I mean like ten times the amount
 Probably a little higher probably three or four times the amount of what everybody else was doing
 I mean it just was
 phenomenal and then the excuses of oh well we can't sell that much
 I mean we we've had a ceiling we we don't have that many opportunities
 That all of a sudden
 diminished dramatically right so then it was a okay this can be done we've proven this can be done
 How do we get everybody up to all the current team members up to the same pace or dang close to it
 Or do we do something else so having somebody come in externally and impacting your team could be a
 phenomenal move
 Especially if you're looking to shake things up especially if you're looking to change things up so
 What is the third thing that we need to consider? Well
 Leveraging the risks notice that I said leveraging the risks and not
 Managing the risks
 We speak to all my ss and sees out there risk isn't always a bad thing guys. It's it's not
 Many times it is but for somebody like me. I'm I'm a somebody who likes to take calculated risks
 I like to calculate what is the risk how is it gonna fail how could the succeed?
 What am I willing to lose in this process every how could this impact culture?
 You know communication everything clients vendors
 You know I will always try and calculate what is the risk so
 As I just mentioned sometimes shaking things up can be a good thing
 The key is getting the risk factor to work in your favor
 Sometimes that's exactly what you want
 That being said bringing somebody new over a current team member can have absolute side effects
 So let's say you're bringing somebody and putting them in a role
 You know that's going to be above other people that this person has considered to be peers
 You know promotions have a level of consistency instability
 You already know what to expect from this person but also it could perpetuate existing mindset
 It could perpetuate existing attitudes so if you've not been managing the culture well
 This could totally be a problem
 What happens if you elevate somebody in a role and you did not know that there is
 Unresolved conflict with other team members
 You know they may be playing well in the sandbox but they don't like each other
 And now you've elevated somebody over one of those team members and they're like I am not going to
 bust my butt for this person. I don't like them. I sure as I don't like them being my leader now
 You know you might be creating more issues than you're prepared to deal with and sometimes when somebody already has a
 relationship
 With somebody that you know maybe they don't like each other then it makes it much more difficult
 Taking the internal promotion then bringing in somebody from the outside who's already ready for that
 Specific level right because obviously the people underneath that person don't know that person
 It's still a struggle but if you haven't managed the culture well if you haven't managed the teams well
 Then guess what this could be a problem
 However the internal promotion
 many times with mature people a great culture is phenomenal
 Many times people already know that that's the person that should be you know elevated to that role
 and it's a great opportunity for you to offer
 the promotion to anybody who wants it and
 Those who aren't ready for it. It's a great opportunity for you to give them growth paths
 What do I mean by that?
 A lot of times people like oh I deserve that role. I should be in that role and you know that they aren't there yet
 They're not ready for it but this gives you a great opportunity to ask them what makes you prepared to take on this role
 What what do you see in yourself and then you get to share here's some struggles that I see
 That show me that you're not ready for this promotion to be in this role
 But here's what I want to put together if you would like to be in this place
 Here's some things I want you to work on so believe it or not this internal hiring process many times
 Even you could do this even if you're still offering it externally it gives you the opportunity to
 Sit down with a team member and go
 Here's the things I need to see for me before I could consider putting you in a role like that
 Now some of you are like oh great now I'm gonna lose team members most of the time you don't
 But the ones you do lose are the ones you're already ready to lose
 The one that walks out the door because they're just so frustrated and upset at you
 Chances are you've been holding on to that person a way too long and not have you know how them accountable
 For their attitudes and their actions and the way that they've led their role and so believe it or not
 It may be scary to lose a person
 But if it's somebody who should have been gone a long time ago and held accountable and pushed on and
 You know either lead to success or lead to out the door well then believe or not many times that person is actually gonna be
 It's gonna be a blessing that they've moved on to something else
 God has plans for everybody
 And not everybody has to be inside of your business, right?
 So I know that sounds tough
 But those of you that have that type of team member on your team you know exactly what I'm talking about if this doesn't resonate with you
 Then there's a good chance you've not had that type of person on your team yet
 Either way it all comes back to your leadership. Are you leading them incredibly well?
 So what about leveraging the risks with the external well the external hires are less of a sure thing
 Oh my gosh, I think we all
 We all understand that right but that risk can be leveraged in the sense that the new hire coming on board is a blank slate that you
 Get to write the new coat of your culture on
 So a great thing leveraging the risk is yes
 They may not be a sure thing but it also gives you an opportunity to
 Start with a clean slate on here's how we do things culturally now
 For a lot of you you have some folks inside of your team that you're working with culturally that they've been on your team for a while
 You know they're not operating the way that you desire inside of your culture and so you're working with them
 Well sometimes it's great to bring somebody in brand spanking new
 Blank slate
 Teach them the culture and help them to see you know choices and consequences
 What it looks like to be successful what's not being successful
 You know all the things that you need for them to fit into the culture
 Hopefully you're not dumping that person in with somebody who's
 Being toxic or poisonous in your culture and then allowing them to screw up the new hire right that obviously would not be a good thing
 So keep these things in mind when you are assessing the skill set in your own backyard versus
 Fishing for new talent in the pool. So number one again time and cost involve which could very depending on the importance of the role obviously number two
 The impact on your team the culture
 morale
 You know when you're when you're looking at promoting versus a new person and also number three
 Let the risks work in your favor leveraging your choice
 You know old versus new to work for you. So maybe today was a lot for you to process
