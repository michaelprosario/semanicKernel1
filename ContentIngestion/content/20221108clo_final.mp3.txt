 Examining our lives to find the lies we tell ourselves that is coming up next
 Welcome to the Chris LaCardo Show where we discuss leadership and life and
 Discover that business is what you do not who you are
 Welcome to the show folks
 I hope you're having a fabulous day wherever you are today
 We are talking about examining our lives and as we look back on a
 trial that happened in 399 BC and shortly before being sentenced to death
 The famous philosopher Socrates or so-crates for some of you who get that is recorded as saying
 The unexamined life is not worth living and I got to tell you I
 Completely agree with that statement now what kind of life are you living and I don't mean
 You know, are you examining to find out?
 Do you have enough stuff do you make enough money is everything going your way what I mean is
 Are you living life well?
 Let me say that again
 Are you living life well?
 Well, there's all kinds of traps that we fall into that provenance from living our
 I hate to say the phrase but best life
 You know, I don't have a better way sand instead living the the fullest life we possibly can right
 We talked about that in episode 467 what is your best life look like?
 But it takes a little courage to look inside yourself and determine what's really actually going on
 So today I'm gonna invite you to examine your life to make sure that it's worth living now
 I'm not saying that you're gonna find that life isn't worth living
 I'm saying let's take a hard look at it and ask ourselves is this the life I want to be living?
 Can I change it should I do something different right?
 Obviously not living is not an option so
 We need to examine what needs to be enhanced we need to
 We need to see what needs to be edited out and this can and be an incredible boost to personal growth
 It can be an incredible boost to longevity
 Fantastic boost to health if we discover the great things that we need to change right now here's a deal
 Without examining our lives our thoughts our actions
 We tend to get stuck in harmful and
 Distorted thinking patterns. I know you there's a bunch of you that heard me just say that and what yep
 I've been there about a thousand times before so there are lies that we are going around believing things
 It were telling ourselves and sometimes it's even things that other people tell us as well that we are believing
 But most of the time
 Hear me on this most of the time they are left unverified they are left unexamined
 We've all struggled with untrue recorded memos in our head and often set a loop and repeat and just allow that
 Suck it or run over and over and over and over again right about ourselves about other people
 About our potential about our problems about our current circumstances about past circumstances that we should have handled
 differently whatever it is
 But rehearsing a lie over and over doesn't actually make it true
 It just gives it more power over you. Let me say that again
 Rehearsing the lie doesn't make it actually true. It just makes it more powerful
 Over you it gives it more power over you and set on repeat lies get embedded in our thinking
 Which makes it become part of our inner dialogue and even sometimes that lie becomes part of our character
 Ouch that sentence right there should be scary
 How many times does a lie that I allow to run around my head actually become part of my character
 If you have not checked out episode 47 on white character counts
 Make sure you do so that you gain more perspective now what do we come back
 gaining perspective and getting power over the lies of victim mentality
 Folks if you've been listening to me for any length of time
 Then you know the number one issue when it comes to business when it comes to family when it comes to friendships
 Is having a lack of high quality communication to make sure that you are absolutely winning
 In every aspect of your life it all starts with having great
 Communication the best way to get that communication is to understand your personality style and to
 Understand the personality style of the folks that you're spending the most time with whether be at work
 Whether it be at home the best way to do that is to go to christlcurdle.com/store and get your personality profile and personality profiles for your team
 Two day get it for your family members today as you go through that profile you will begin to see the greatest ways to communicate go to christlcurdle.com/store today
 Okay, so right now it's a society
 it is
 very fashionable to be a victim
 Victim mentality is very trendy. It's very fashionable right now it can it can gain you big points when it comes to other people
 Points like you get a lot of attention from people or
 People feel like they owe you something because you're a victim or it gives you a platform
 Right to share your victim hood
 Now it's an interesting thing as I say that victim mentality is trendy right now it's it's very fashionable it is
 It's crazy
 I can remember there was a time that if somebody had victim mentality it was that one person right
 You could go oh gosh, I know who that one person is and they stood out like a sore thumb
 You actually kind of stand out now if you don't have victim mentality and you're not expressing it everywhere on every
 Social platform or every conversation where you're complaining about how horrible things aren't how much of a victim you are
 If you just turn on the TV everything from the nightly news to reality TV shows
 They're all rated by who the biggest victim is and who deserves something in return
 Look at what's happening politically
 It is ridiculous to see the platforms that are being taken to claim how much victim hood there is in our country
 Right it's like every day there's some new thing coming out that somebody's a victim somewhere and
 The government needs to go and fight for this victim hood, right now I'm not talking about legitimate
 Victims I'm talking about victim mentality
 Or you're gonna find a way to make something a problem where you're gonna be a victim to something in life
 And some of it is just beyond
 Disgusting an evil
 I won't man there's
 No
 I'm not gonna share some of the things I've heard lately
 Right now because that's not the direction I want to go in
 But I can tell you the victim mentality is getting
 Incredibly evil and incredibly disgusting in many areas so
 Anyways moving on
 It's important for us to distinguish between the victims of abuse or crime and we'll talk more about that shortly and
 Those who believe they are entitled or do something so as I go through this
 If you are hearing me say
 Nobody's a victim then you're probably struggling with victim mentality right now because that's not what I'm saying
 Like I just said I'm not talking about the legitimate situations where somebody
 Actually is victimized. I'm talking about the situations where people make themselves victims and there's about
 Billion different ways that people do that now maybe because of their
 Mental processing of life events or trauma or
 You know trauma with a small tea like not actually legitimate trauma
 What other people say or do on and on and on that they feel like life and others as well?
 Oh them something
 Right
 So it is amazing to me
 Where there was a time where something like PTSD
 Was something that was assigned to people who legitimately experienced incredibly traumatic situations
 Now if somebody cuts you off on the freeway you have PTSD of driving on the on the freeway
 Geez not that crap off. I mean come on
 This is this is amazing what's happening right but somehow
 People are
 Processing their life
 In choosing that they are victims like to an extent to a great extent right
 So here's what I want you to hear first
 Victim mentality is an acquired personality characteristic
 Victim mentality is an acquired personality
 Characteristic
 It's something that's becoming part of your
 Character let that scare you
 If you're somebody who struggles with victim mentality and let me tell you we all have
 Had our bouts of victim mentality right every single one of us has at some point you know
 Hopefully we've all
 Discovered a quickly and got over a quickly but we've all experienced it
 But if you're somebody who's consistently struggling with victim mentality it's now part of your character
 That should be something that you really spend sometime thinking about so it's a state of mind
 Want to person things that the entire world is against them or a group of people is against them or
 You know everything is happening to them and they have no power they have no control over it
 I think they can't do anything about it right
 This is what we want to
 Unacquire
 Because it's ultimately toxic both to you into those around you
 folks listen
 Victim mentality isn't just toxic to you it affects those around you as well right and
 Leaders guess what if you got a lot of victim mentality inside of your business
 It's not just the person who's being a victim that's being affected by it
 But those around them who are having to hear about it or maybe those are partaking in it
 So we want to combat it and then we want to get rid of it once we get rid of it
 Then we can find and really start examining our lives and see what needs to change and what we can do and and whether or not this is worth
 Living the way that we are living all right. Let's dig into where this victim mentality typically comes from now
 these
 untrue memos
 Get buried in our our mind this negative self talk a lot of it comes from our root system
 It typically crops up in in two distinct ways encouraging us to either act out as victims
 Or sometimes once it's a great while it causes us to act out as a villain or believe it or not
 We it could be both we've even talked about that recently
 That's why we're talking so much about self awareness on the show
 self awareness is
 The ability to observe yourself objectively and determine how your thoughts actions and emotions do or do not align
 with your internal standards. So why is self awareness so important because it creates an ongoing self
 examination of one's own life
 If you are self aware your self examining
 If you're not self aware
 You're not self examining
 Well, how do I know if I'm there or not? How do I know if I'm self examining or if I'm self aware?
 If you're not aware of how you act react
 If you're not aware of how situations or circumstances
 Trigger specific responses
 If you're not aware of whether or not those responses are healthy or unhealthy
 you know toxic or you know
 not toxic
 Then you're not very self aware
 If you're somebody who's struggling with victim mentality and you're not recognizing how
 Toxic it is to your life then you're not very self aware
 Which means that you're not examining yourself very well
 We've talked about it before so much of our misery and suffering is self-inflicted and
 It makes for a terrible life
 Now unless you are that person who you know misery loves company unless you are that person who just loves living in misery
 Then you know you're probably feeling like there's a lot of things you're experiencing
 That aren't worth experiencing that you want to do something about you want to change it
 So our first up towards solving a problem is identifying and acknowledging that the problem actually exists
 So to address or to fix the problem you must be able to see it
 If you can't see that you have a problem
 How can you fix it and
 Listen here me on this if you can't see that you have a problem
 You can't possibly know that you have victim mentality
 Super important how we're gonna get victim mentality out we have to be very aware that it actually exists in the first place
 Now to see the problem exists you've got to bring your attention to the problem
 to bring attention to it you must gain greater perspective on
 you on yourself
 This is why we lead people to greater perspective and offer tools to find growth in healing
 And speaking of greater perspective growth in healing which is what this
 Show is largely about let me pause and mention that we are coming up on our
 500th episode of the Chris La Cordoche show which is crazy exciting

 I'll state it again to make sure that this is very clear when we dive into victim mentality out
 I want you to hear that there aren't legitimate victims out there of course there are there's victims of abuse crimes
 Tragedy accidents even even war I know that some of you've been through hell on earth
 How do I know that because we've experienced a lot of folks out of come through next level life that have been legitimate victims
 That have experienced pretty crappy things but we've also had people come through that haven't been through that had victim mentality and they were super glad to discover it
 See it and be able to stop it out pretty quickly
 It's very rare that a person recognizes that they are stuck in victim mentality and when they do and they can see it
 Very rarely does anybody not want to change that. I mean the folks that have come through next level life that have discovered that have been like
 I want this gone
 You know I've always thought I knew who the victim was I never thought it could ever be me
 I want this gone I want this fixed to help me to fix this so here's the point victim mentality is a choice
 It's propped up by the lies that we are telling ourselves so when we come back I'm covering the lies that you may be telling yourself about your own victim
 Freedom it's so powerful
 I don't rejuvenate and almost renewed. I just felt so welcomed and loved and accepted for who I am and not an ounce of judgment
 So I was very comfortable there
 That had a really big impact on me. It's going to be worth it
 It's gonna be hard
 But it's going to be even better on the other side for me. It was just a very refreshing and
 I want to say life giving for me and really was you know I would go to the next level life again and probably again
 Because it's so powerful if you want to experience the same kind of life transformation the same kind of self
 We're in a sin freedom that they have or maybe you're just curious what the process would look like for you
 Then head on over to crissacardo.com slash next level life
 Okay, we're talking about our tendency as humans to not take responsibility for ourselves and our actions
 And instead trying to make everything the fault and and or the responsibility of someone else
 So here's a truth and I hope you're ready for it
 You do have control over your life
 You have control over your thoughts you have control over your responses your will and actions
 Your habits and behaviors you got control
 You can choose to control every bit of that
 But a
 very real reality is lies
 We'll tell you that you are not in control and this is the victim mentality that we all have to battle
 Right? I can hear some of you already thinking but Chris
 You don't know what I've been through you don't know what they've done to me you don't know how hard I've tried and I've failed
 I hear you I literally do
 But I want you to hear me press into that a little bit
 To get to the core of what's going on will have to do some self-examination
 I the person who's teaching this right now has experienced victim mentality
 There've been times that I've looked at a situation and saying to myself
 This is happening to me. I can't do anything about it
 The great thing praise God is that God's allowed me and you
 If you will choose it the ability to examine quickly and I actually evict them
 If not let me stop that lie out as fast as I possibly can so let's deal with the trap of
 Victim hood and how we can actually recognize it so out it's core
 Victim mentality is based on an unhealthy self preoccupation
 Yes
 unhealthy
 Self preoccupation in place of the healthy self awareness which is what we promote around our place
 Right what we promote on the show so what's the difference well
 being preoccupied with oneself you know and unhealthy view of oneself tends to make you feel unworthy
 Parallists and it ultimately tries to shift responsibility to someone else
 That's unhealthy
 What's self preoccupation? Well, it's just being absorbed in preoccupied with ones self as I'm saying this many of you are probably going
 That's never me Chris. I don't ever do that well
 Stick with me because we all experience it
 There's nobody who doesn't so just stick with me so these things take top spot in our thinking
 My own worries doubts fears needs wants desires my worth my value my appearance
 Am I approved?
 Am I accepted?
 These are things that take the top spot in our thinking so why do we focus on things like that?
 Well, it could be in an effort to deflect pain to deflect guilt fear anger shame
 Those are always things that are going to cause us to focus on us and and you know look at inner pain or inner
 Experience or things that are happening to us. It can be distorted thinking patterns that fool us about ourselves
 That maybe we've had since we were kids
 Maybe that's happened since a situation or circumstance that's created a pattern of thought
 As well as it could be distorted thinking patterns that fool us about other people
 Quite often I mean look at what's happening
 All around the world if you just take a look at however you receive information whether it's news or social media or whatever
 Take a look at how often people are being
 Lifted up as victims while other people are being blamed as villains now here's a deal
 I don't believe you can be a victim unless there's a villain
 Why because you have to be a victim
 Too a situation that has somebody behind it right so for many people
 They keep hearing this preaching that their victim or somebody else is a victim and here's the big bad evil people that are making them victims
 And it creates this pattern that we're always looking for somebody to be a villain now this is very different from having a
 Healthy self awareness
 Where we're objectively aware of what's going on around us and how our behaviors affecting other people
 So here's what I'm gonna do we've we've dug into a lot
 We're not gonna make it in one episode so let's wrap up this part one of lies victims tell themselves
 We've been doing a lot of uncovering but let's conclude today by looking back
 Back to Adam and Eve in the garden. Let's look closely for clues
 Where victim mentality ultimately
 Again now one confronted with their sin
 Violating the obvious command that God had given them or go don't eat from
 the specific tree of you know knowledge of good knew well
 They told God that it was someone else's fault if you were reading Genesis 3 the man says to God
 I heard you were approaching and I was afraid yep, there's the fear right there. I
 Adam here's God approaching and he becomes incredibly fearful now
 Some versions might dig deeper and say you know and I was ashamed
 Concept is you still see this response the man continues with God and says
 The woman that you put here with me
 She gave me some fruit from the tree and I ate it
 So in one sentence, let us add him do blinds two people
 The woman first
 blind that you gave me
 Twice in one sentence he blames two different people
 For the situation that he is currently and he shifts the blame to the woman and
 Also to God as well indirectly but still directly to God in just one blow so smart move right well
 Maybe not
 Eve is in the same boat
 Watch this then the Lord God said to the woman what is this you have done the woman said the serpent to see me and I ate
 There it is again
 What were they both doing
 They were both self protecting
 There's a loss of worth due to fear due to shame and so they tried to excuse and exonerate themselves
 Through victim mentality
 And now we're just getting to the good stuff folks
 We're just getting to the good stuff so before I go any further do not miss the next episode
 Well folks that's all the time we've got for today
 I hope this has been helpful
