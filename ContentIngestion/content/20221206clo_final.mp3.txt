 Learning to use the word "no" as a healthy way to find more freedom, more joy and more
 peace in your life. That is coming up next.
 Welcome to the Crystal Cardo Show, where we discuss leadership and life and discover
 that businesses what you do not who you are.
 Welcome to the show, folks. I hope you have a fabulous day wherever you are. Today,
 join me back in the studio from the Poimaine Studios in Sicily.
 It sounds so global.
 He's out, look at us. Which also happens to be Brian's house.
 My lowly apartment.
 We didn't put that sign up when you're cutting a podcast with us.
 Is Brian Alex Brian welcome back to the show?
 It's always a pleasure.
 Haven't seen you in a while. In fact, the last couple episodes.
 I had the distinct pleasure of having as my guest on the show, our president of the Poimaine group,

 Those episodes typically come off 15, 20 minutes.
 I would love to get a little bit deeper into this.
 We talk about boundaries all the time on this show.

 If somebody who's new or you know it immediately and it's not hard to avoid them, but
 there have been plenty of times that because a race was compressed, time wise, that you
 end out with guys, classes below you and slower cars as well.
 You could be flying around the track and all of a sudden you're on top of somebody that
 is just like, "Hey, I can't continue my speed."
 That just really affected my whole time that I'm trying to set.
 But if they move, even there's a benefit of if they just hold their line, you could at least
 get around them and nothing happens.
 But sometimes they know that they're really slow compared to you.
 They try and take care of you.
 It's like, you're going to kill us both.
 Stay where you are.
 Interesting to know that like driving on a track, the ability to go as fast as you want, the ability
 to push yourself is incredible.
 But then there's times like when I drive out on the freeway, obviously I'm able to drive
 my car considerably faster, but it doesn't mean I should.
 There's times where somebody doesn't recognize a speed that you could be driving that they
 might move into your lane.
 And again, I'm not condoning speeding in all those things.
 I'm such a good rule follower.
 This is a great episode for you Chris.
 I'm so looking forward to getting into some of these points.
 Well, it's a funny because I have to put boundaries on myself and just go, because I don't
 recognize if it's a 60 or 70 mile an hour speed limit, it feels like I'm riding a bicycle.
 Sometimes, I mean, it's just because it's a different ability to handle the car, right?
 Where it doesn't seem fast.
 So it's like interesting when you're talking about the 268 miles an hour, I'm like crap,
 that's fast.
 Right?
 Where 145 for me is fast and nice and great on a track.
 I'm talking about not out there on the road.
 That's fun, but I would love to have been able to do like the Autobahn and see how much further
 I can go.
 What could I push you to?
 But at what point am I going to go?
 This is ridiculous.
 I feel so out of control.
 So it's interesting to know that there's times you have to put boundaries.
 I look forward to talking about the boundaries.
 We're going to put on other people.
 But how many times do you recognize?
 You've got to put boundaries on you and say, hey, listen, you're the one affecting, if I
 was to go out there and drive on the freeway the way I drive on a racetrack, I'm going to
 mess up a whole lot of people and that's just not acceptable.
 So I don't think I've ever asked you how fast have you been on when you've been in your race
 car on a track and it's approved and legal to do so.
 What's your top speed that you can talk about going?
 Yeah, so legal top speed I will share with you.
 Well, I won't share any other speeds.
 My legal top speed.
 Yeah, it's 145 because so down at Daytona.
 So what we do in formula cars is we race road tracks.
 So whenever we get out to something like an oval or a trial, unfortunately we never get
 to just run the trial.
 So in other words, instead of us being able to get up to speed as fast as we could and
 continue to go, we run half the track come off the wall at 145 miles an hour, diving down
 into the inner track, slamming the brakes, dropping gears turning.
 So and then we come go through the inner track, come back out and we're only a little bit
 further past where we just came off the wall.
 And then we run to the other side as fast as we can, about 130 miles an hour, drop gears
 come into what's called a bus stop.
 It's a little left right left, back out onto the main track.
 Well, I've had the benefit.
 And so there I could normally get up to about 140 before I have to break off the wall.
 But I had the benefit of a what's considered to the same as like an indie car being out there
 with us that came by and I got into his his his his wash his his his the the the drag behind
 him the draft.
 And it literally pulled me five miles an hour faster to like it allowed my car to go
 five miles an hour faster to the start finish, which was just fabulous.
 So that was that was my fastest on track.
 But I mean we would do well over 200 and some out if we were able to just stay on the
 oval.
 That actually stopped.
 Yeah.
 That's fast.
 I will not talk about the show visions like that.
 I will not talk about the Shelby that was sent to me 825 horsepower that I was allowed to
 drive by one of our amazing clients and what's we got that too.
 So we'll just leave the whole.
 Legal only folks where legal only legal only legal.
 I don't know about.
 I mean it was maybe 72 miles an hour in that 825 horsepower maybe 70.
 I'm sure.
 Maybe.
 All right.
 So with all that folks when we come back how to use no as a boundary marker and how it can
 benefit you that's coming up next.
 Hey folks, it's coming up the next level leadership live event of 2023 will be here before

 All right.
 We are back and we're talking about boundaries.
 Well, we're talking about racing and needed boundaries but Brian take away from here.
 Let's dive into some great information that we need to know.
 Well, just like you said a minute ago, it's great when we're talking about boundaries and
 other people.
 We are going to talk about that.
 In fact, if you're one of those kinds of people that find it difficult to say no to others,
 my hope is you've got a little bit of, you know, you're going to be encouraged to place healthy
 boundaries.
 What I love about what we're going to do here is we're going to get super, super practical.
 You know, as you mentioned, some of those boundaries that are healthy and we're getting stuck
 and where we'd lack freedom in our own lives is where we're not telling ourselves no enough.
 And just like these guide rails that we're just talking about in speed limits and clearly
 marked areas on road and where there's safety and there's expectations and all of that.
 All of that comes into play here on these boundaries.
 So today we're going to talk about five powerful benefits of saying no, whether that's to yourself
 to others that you know or to others that you don't know.
 How do we in a healthy way with the right spirit?
 How do we say that and not feel guilty for saying no at times because we're saying yes to
 something else.
 And so that's what I hope we're able to get into.
 If you want to read the first one, I'll just kind of comment here there, but I'm going to let you
 steal the show.
 It is your show anyway.
 Well, you know, I love that we're hitting this because I think you just mentioned something
 that is powerful when it comes to setting boundaries and that's the guilt side of it.
 So as we go through this, you know, so many times as we hit a topic like this, there
 needs to be a caveat or or disclaimer.
 The concept of what we're talking about when it comes to setting healthy boundaries needs to
 be that they are healthy boundaries.
 So it is not the I'm setting a boundary because I'm selfish, I'm self-centered, I'm being a
 jerk about this, I'm going to be controlling our manipulative.
 That is not the aspect of what we're talking about.
 Instead, what we're saying is that there is a need for a boundary, you know, just like
 I was saying, I could go drive on the freeway the way that I know how to drive a vehicle, but
 that's not healthy for, you know, could it end up really bad for me if somebody else doesn't
 know what's going on and enters my lane, but it's also not healthy for other people to
 scare the crap out of somebody else, you know, because you're acting like an idiot on the
 freeway, right?
 So as we go through this, it's got to be the big caveat is that it's healthy.
 So the first powerful benefit of saying no is that saying no is an exercise of our will.
 So it's a choice.
 It amplifies discernment, saying no helps me examine and discern my values, it helps me to
 exert choice, it helps me to determine limits.
 So the thing that we have to understand is that just like you said, if I say no to something
 that I may very well be saying yes to something else, right?
 Like yes to health, yes to, I don't want this manipulation, yes to, I don't want this control
 in my life, right?
 So a key thing to understand is that it is okay for me to exercise my will if something is
 happening in an unhealthy way to me.
 So let's say I've had a lot lately whether it's just random people that you're experiencing
 or working through something with a conversation.
 I've had an interesting number of situations lately where somebody is feeling very out of
 control in the moment of feeling out of control, they guilt me.
 You know, there's a guilt transfer, there's a, you know, a controlling statement about what
 I'm doing or what I'm going to do or whatever else.
 And this is not uncommon with what we do for a living, right?
 We experience this when people feel out of control, they respond.
 They usually have what we would call a surface level response.
 And sometimes that is to try and blame the other person for something that's happening.
 And if it's happening, this is always my thing.
 What is ask yourself, did I just do that thing that they said, is this really happening?
 Did I suggest that?
 Whatever.
 If the answer is yes, then man, I need to take responsibility immediately.
 The thing is with what we do for a living rarely ever, rarely ever ever, is it legit, right?
 Because usually it's, we're trying to guide somebody or we're having a tough conversation
 with something or even maybe, you know, maybe you're having a conversation with a team
 member and they're feeling out of control.
 And their way to respond is to push something back at you.
 Well, it's your fault because, well, you didn't do or you did this.
 And the question in that moment is, is that accurate?
 If it's not accurate, then this is a time that I can ask myself how important is it for me
 to put in a healthy boundary.
 Now, my level of healthy boundary is considerably different than a lot of folks because I've
 been doing this for a very long time.
 So for some people, the suggestion of, well, you just did this or you're trying to control this
 or you, you, whatever it is that the accusation, the attack that comes out for some people,
 it's an immediate huge wall up, which that's not healthy.
 We don't want to wall up.
 We don't want to close ourselves in.
 We don't want to keep healthy people out.
 The goal is what do I do with the situation?
 So many times for somebody who has not been very experienced at setting healthy boundaries, sometimes
 they need to put a very hard healthy boundary in place.
 That is not acceptable.
 That is not truth.
 That is not what happened.
 I'm not going to receive that whatever it is.
 You know, there can be different levels of, here's the boundary I'm putting in place.
 The key is it's there will, if they choose it.
 If they choose to protect themselves, if they choose to put up a healthy boundary, then they
 can stop or at least attempt very hard to stop the situation currently to keep themselves
 healthy.
 They're choice.
 They can do it.
 The problem is is when we experience, for me, my level of it might not be putting in any
 hard healthy boundary.
 It might be me pushing back with questions.
 Hey, help me to understand how I did that.
 Hey, help me to understand where you experienced that.
 For me, because I'm not going to receive it as a big attack, I'm expecting that the person's
 probably going to be struggling.
 So instead, I go for the, well, point this out to me.
 Help me to understand this.
 And what you'll see is usually if it's somebody controlling or manipulative, they can't answer
 the question.
 They're going to go somewhere else and deflect somewhere else.
 But again, this is what I do for living.
 So it's not that difficult for me to God them.
 The key here is, is recognizing that if you did not do anything wrong, if this is somebody
 who is trying to make you feel a specific way, I do use my air quotes because nobody can make
 you feel anyway, all they can do is highly suggest that you feel something, right?
 Well, it's your fault that this is happening.
 Well, you're screwing this up.
 Well, you did this thing over here.
 If none of that is actually true, but I receive it as truth, then now it is my reality.
 Right?
 So what we call this as somebody is suggesting they're trying to set your reality.
 Brian, here's what you did and it could be a complete and utter lie.
 But if you receive it, now it is your reality.
 So an important thing for us to understand, number one, is that it's an exercise of your
 will to say no if no is accurate, right?
 If no is correct, and we're using no as the example for the boundary, but you need to do
 this thing.
 You need to make this happen.
 You're the problem with this.
 If all of that is somebody trying to suggest that you experience something really badly about
 yourself, then no is a perfectly good answer.
 Does all that make sense?
 Yeah, it really doesn't.
 I just want to highlight the freedom aspect here.
 Let me just chime in on that where saying no as an exercise of the will is a way that we're
 showing what we don't want and we're, you know, by exercising the will, expressing it.
 Also, yeah, we're by expressing that we're able to actually discern the things that are
 inside of us and we're setting value.
 And that's what we're going to get to in the next statement because I think this is so important
 that we understand.
 And right now we're looking at that exterior where we're saying no to things around us or other
 people trying to manipulate us and there's freedom there.
 There's also freedom to exercise our will, you know, no, I'm not going to have that third
 Coca-Cola.
 I'm not going to do this.
 You know, the second big Mac is too much and I need to say no to that.
 You know, there's freedom that we create by exercising our will.
 But when we don't say no, it's like we're living in servitude.
 We're still a slave or we become a slave either to ourselves, desires, the desires of others.
 And we're learning to set up those healthy boundaries in an effort to create that freedom
 space that we can actually thrive as a human.
 Yeah.
 So just kind of piggyback on that.
 The concept of, you know, putting boundaries on myself, right?
 We're talking about this in two different aspects.
 One is the boundary of, do I put on a healthy boundary to somebody else by saying no, but as
 you just brought up, you know, it goes back to the car driving too fast on the freeway
 type of of comment at what point do I look at myself and say no, at what point do I look
 at myself and say, this is unacceptable.
 This isn't healthy for me.
 Right.
 I mean, I think everybody can point to alcohol, drugs, hanging out with bad people, bad relationships.
 I think that's an easy one.
 I think it's also easy for somebody to say, you know, hey, too big Mac is too much.
 Hey, one big Mac.
 He's probably too much.
 Right.
 No offense.
 Who does big Mac McDonald's?
 Sure.
 McDonald's.
 I'm not like, is that a burger king?
 Is that a McDonald's?
 I don't know.
 The key is is where are you in your health journey?
 Is this a smart choice?
 And what does a boundary say to that?
 I am, I know.
 For a fact, there are things that I, you know, I'm still, I've been on this journey to
 get led out of my body for years.
 And it's, I think we're over four years now.
 People always say, how did that ever happen?
 You look paint chips.
 No, I did not look paint chips.
 But I do believe that there was a couple of year period that I lived in a house that had led pipes
 in my early 20s.
 And I think that probably is what made a huge impact on this.
 The key that I'm saying here is that I am completely aware that there are things I can
 eat unless I want to feel sick for the next four days.
 You know, there are certain things that I cannot do unless I want to feel sick.
 And so there's boundaries that I've got to put on myself to say, hey, that's just not
 only is it not acceptable.
 Just get past any type of desire for it because it's just going to hurt you in the long run.
 So definitely saying no is an exercise of our will.
 And it also helps us to understand our values.
 It helps us to understand our limits.
 And, you know, it determines our limits.
 It defines our limits.
 It doesn't mean that we don't screw things up.
 So my wife and I, you know, she's got line disease and has had that for a while.
 So probably once a year, we're like, we're going to go eat this one meal and know that we're
 going to pay for it.
 But, you know, it's once a year.
 We're all right.
 We're going to be fine.
 So it also shows, hey, we can have a limit here.
 And, you know, if it's acceptable, great.
 It's just not something that we do twice a year.
 So number two, saying no helps us to define, to express and to reinforce what's value
able to us.
 So this is important.
 I'm going to say yes to it and in turn, no to these other things.
 This is something that's not hard for people to understand, right?
 You know, the old saying every time you say yes to something, you're saying no to something
 else.
 Well, as you pointed out, Brian, there's the converse of that as well.
 Every time I say no to something, it's very possible I'm saying yes to something else.
 And maybe me saying, hey, this is something that, you know, saying no to that is saying that
 I need to value myself better.
 I need to, you know, express what's important to me.
 I need to make decisions to myself.
 What's okay and what's not okay.
 We had a fabulous, my wife had a fabulous conversation with one of our granddaughters about
 a situation where she was getting a lot of peer pressure on this one decision to make.
 And she's just like, I don't understand why it's not okay.
 Everybody else is doing this.
 And why is it not okay for me?
 And she was able to talk to her through the lens of God.
 Do you know that God is your father?
 Yes, do you know that he is a king?
 Yes.
 Do you know that being his daughter that makes you a princess?
 Yes.
 So if your his daughter is this what he, in just this phenomenal, incredible conversation with
 a young girl that as she walked through it, the, I don't understand why I don't get to do
 this turn to, oh my gosh, I get to do this other thing.
 Wow, that's so great.
 I can do this in a gay for a different choice, right?
 And then also allowing her to recognize.
 So when you feel that peer pressure from other people, from other kids, from other
 adults, whatever it is, then the know is defining what's valuable to you.
 No, you know, I understand that that's something that you want to do.
 I understand that something you want to experience, but that's not something I want.
 That's not something I want in my life.
 So it's interesting teaching a nine year old this.
 It can be an incredibly powerful moment teaching a 39 year old.
 This sometimes can be incredibly difficult.
 You know, that you can, you need to make choices on what you, what you truly do value
 and then say yes and no according.
 Yeah, no, I love that.
 And what comes to mind is you're talking, you know, we, we both met at Dave Ramsey's place,
 financial piece and, you know, I remember showing up having said yes to a lot of credit card
 debt before, you know, and interestingly, getting there and renewing my mind and purging
 from a lot of the bad, just emotionally driven habits that I had, you know, saying no, created,
 you know, the ability to place value somewhere that was really valuable.
 And instead of saying yes to spending my money on things that did not help me at all.
 But instead it said yes to the savings in my bank account, it said yes to paying my bills.
 It said yes to no debt.
 It said yes, you know, in saying no, we're automatically a lot of times saying yes to things
 that are more valuable.
 And so I love the idea that keeping it in my mind, you know, because we're only too deep
 so far in this is that no is an exercise of my will.
 And it helps me create freedom.
 No is is showing me where my values are.
 And it's allowing those things to become even more valuable.
 And I love this heart of the, the positive spin on saying no to things.
 I think it's super important.
 Absolutely.
 It is just one you realize the freedom that it does give you, you know, um,
 there have been things in my life that I have been trained throughout my life to believe
 that I have to consistently do, you know, that I have to work a specific way that I have to,
 you know, run my business as a specific way or whatever.
 When you get to this place of discovering just because that's the way that somebody else doesn't
 in, it's the right way for you that you can adjust things.
 Then all of a sudden you start to discover a level of freedom.
 You may not recognize it as freedom at first.
 And I'm not talking about, hey, you don't have to go work.
 Just go sit around and wait for stuff to come to you.
 That's not what I'm talking about.
 I'm talking about making right choices.
 Oh, gosh, it doesn't have to look this way, you know, buddy, my, my, the way that he's
 able to do his business on the amount of hours that his team works works for him.
 Now our company, unfortunately, um, we have yet to discover how to do it the way that he's doing
 it, but it doesn't mean that we're not looking for it, but for him to be able to go, you
 know, what I'm going against the norm.
 I'm not doing it this way.
 You know, it was just a fantastic thing to see that he's not only been able to pull it off
 successfully, but with continued growth.
 So sometimes discovering freedom in just because everybody else does it this way doesn't mean
 that you have to do it this way.
 It's very powerful and very free.
 All right, number three, saying no creates space, whether it's geographic borders or borders
 in time.
 So think of that, you know, quote, do not enter effectively illustrates the property line, which
 inside of which we find freedom.
 So there's a saying from Albert K.
 Miss, that is, your freedom effectively ends where mine begins.
 Think about that, right?
 So if my freedom is infringing on yours, then we have a problem, right?
 We have to recognize that we both should have a level of freedom as long as my freedom doesn't
 impact or affect your freedom.
 So in fact, absolute freedom, the absence of rules or restrictions is a recipe for chaos.
 And the great thing is that no creates space around time as well.
 So for example, for us, we honor the Sabbath.
 Sabbath says no in order to create space to create freedom.
 It brings an end to the work and the fatigue so that there can be rest for us.
 We believe that that is a great blessing from God that's saying no, we stop working when
 we're supposed to.
 Now, a lot of people would say, oh my gosh, Chris, you're living a sligolistic life.
 No, that is not actually accurate.
 That is not there's no salvation that comes from following God's ways of doing things.
 Salvation is a faith issue, not a works issue, however.
 Many people don't realize because the advent of a pagan emperor on our belief system
 that there's a lot of things that they're staying away from that is keeping them from
 a close relationship with God.
 And I will tell you, when I was back in ministry back in the day, back in the late 90s, I used
 to teach that stuff too.
 Praise God, he's helped me in a whole lot of people to recognize that the impact of a pagan emperor
 needs to get ripped out.
 And we need to follow God the way that we're supposed to follow God once again.
 Doesn't mean anything about salvation from doing the right things or salvation from any
 aspect of work instead, it means recognizing the blessings of God and how he wants to love
 us and take care of us.
 With that being said, that's one of the things that my wife and I do.
 We say no to work one day a week.
 We say no to work does not exist on this time.
 We don't work.
 We have six days that God has given us to just do whatever we want to.
 And we bust it those six days.
 We do a lot.
 In the accomplished, we work through our appointment group, the business.
 We do work from the ridge when we can, which is fabulous, right?
 We're able to get a bunch of stuff done.
 But by saying no when it comes to Sabbath, what happens is we're able to say yes to us.
 We're able to create this parameter in our work time that says work stops here every single
 week we're done.
 And we go Friday night to Saturday night, sundown to sundown.
 Now, if you realize a day is not actually midnight tonight, we say it is here in the US in
 a lot of countries.
 But when you look publicly, God says the night in a day is a day.
 So there you go.
 So for us, we followed this and we make sure that we're giving ourselves time to focus on him,
 time to rest in each other.
 I will tell you, I'm a guy who's never been able to take naps in my life.
 I know there's a lot of you out there that have suggested it.
 You think it's fabulous.
 It's great.
 I've got foam.
 Fear of missing out.
 My whole life, if it came to, if I was tired, and I want to take a nap on the middle of a day
 on a weekend or something, I was like, nope, because then I'm going to lose time and man,
 I'll tell you what, I have actually started taking naps if I'm tired.
 It's fun to get to the Sabbath day and go, I ain't got another else going on.
 I'm going to pop and bed and tell you that for a little while.
 It is amazing.
 It's incredible.
 The blessing physically.
 But I will tell you on top of creating these parameters, these times, these breaks in space,
 whether it's a physical space or a spiritual one.
 I will tell you that it has had incredible spiritual implications on me, my wife, family members,
 where we have started to recognize that when we do recognize the blessing of God that he's
 put in place, he didn't take it out, man, take it out.
 When we start recognizing these things, all of a sudden we start seeing the blessings that come
 with it as a loving father.
 I think for us, one of the things that we have really focused on is where else is it okay
 for us to say no?
 You know, where else is it okay?
 We're trying we have this mission from God we believe on the ridge.
 Setting things up and it's taking a long time.
 But things are moving and we're finally got the beginnings of the small building.
 They're literally working on it right now.
 Praise God, Ali.
 But we've had to look at our ability to pull things off and say, you know what, we're going
 to trust God.
 I say, no to ourselves.
 We're going to say no to pushing and forcing things to happen.
 And I've had a lot of clients that have asked me, how are you able to be so patient with this
 process?
 And I'm like, because when I take control, it's only as good as I can do it.
 But if I don't take control, and I trust God, that doesn't mean that I'm not incredibly
 diligent.
 I'm always move, move, push buttons, push buttons, see what I can get to move.
 But when I see that it's not moving, I back up.
 I spend time in prayer.
 I spend time putting it back in God's hands.
 Hey, this is obviously not going.
 And I can make it happen.
 I can do it run around and make something happen over here.
 But when I do that, then I'm actually taking away from what God was planning to do.
 So by saying no to control, don't control this thing.
 Don't force this thing to happen because you know you could do it.
 Instead, trust God.
 Trust that he's going to do it.
 Trust he's going to do it right.
 If we sing a time, I do that.
 It comes out not just a little better, but considerably better.
 So the third thing is that we have to recognize is that whether it is geographic, whether it's
 spiritual, whether it's personal, whether it's emotional, no creates spaces as well.
 Yeah, I love that.
 Just like you're saying about how Sabbath will create space in that space is freedom, is
 rest.
 I think it was Dennis Prager talking about Sabbath.
 He talked about how it reminded Israel that they were no longer slaves, but free.
 And it was for freedom that Christ has set us free, right?
 And so we're actually able to enjoy freedom, experience freedom, the depths of freedom when
 we create the space for, you know, geographically, I shut my doors.
 I'm going to do this habit of walking around at night before I go to bed and I make sure all
 the doors are shut and locked.
 So why do I do that?
 I don't do that out of fear necessarily.
 I do that to create a space where I'm safe, I'm secure, I'm content, you know, I live alone,
 but I have two little animals in my house.
 I don't want them to wander out.
 Why?
 Oh, well, you're just restricting their freedom.
 No, they're not used to being outside and they can walk into the street and die.
 And so I'm creating a place where freedom can actually be enjoyed.
 And you know, whether it's that geographic or the temporal, the time element, you know, you
 can work seven days a week and you can be a slave.
 But creating that space with the word no sets limits and boundaries, you know, just like
 we're in our car, there are guiderails, there are lines, there are rules.
 And when we follow that, we experience the freedom that can only come by following those things.
 Yeah, it's, yeah, I'm so glad you mentioned that because so when we look at Sabbath, Sabbath
 was not given at Mount Sinai, Sabbath was given at creation.
 On the seventh day, God set that day apart as holy or supposed to follow that.
 If you look at the Israelites and the mixed multitude, it wasn't just Israelites that came
 out of Egypt after the Exodus or during the Exodus, but there was a mixed multitude of Gentile
 believers that came to trust in the God of Israel that coming out Moses reminded them to keep
 the Sabbath holy.
 It wasn't until like got to Mount Sinai that God gave it as one of his 10 commandments.
 Right.
 So there's a lot of folks that are listening to this going, Chris, you're just wrong.
 Please listen to me.
 If you're somebody who's hearing this and you're getting stuck on this, I used to teach
 what you believe.
 I used to teach it.
 I we've what they're in about a year ago, found some of my preaching notes from back in the
 90s.
 I used to teach that as well.
 Here's my one high suggestion with an open mind and there's plenty of books out there, plenty
 of stuff you can actually go to discover this, but there's one fantastic one done by George
 Barnett, which is from the research in Frank Violet from the research aspect, which is called
 pagan Christianity.
 Go read the book.
 Don't do the audio.
 You'll miss a whole lot of stuff.
 Just read the book.
 I will tell you you're probably not ready for it, but if you feel God calling on your heart to
 go and do so, go do so.
 A big piece of what we're talking about here is discovering a freedom that you're not even
 aware exists yet.
 And to you experience it, you don't even know that it exists.
 And that's just one aspect.
 And it has been a powerful thing in all of our lives to see the blessings that have come
 from experiencing those freedom.
 So pagan Christianity makes sure you go get it, feel free to ask me any questions you want.
 I am not up for debates on stuff until you actually know stuff.
 So if it's to debate something because you want to yell at me and all that kind of crap,
 that's pointless.
 If you want to ask anyone since your questions, please please, please hit me up with that podcast
 at cristool.com.
 No problem.
 I'll talk to you about this.
 No problem.
 All right.
 And we come back, getting unstuck and finding the freedom that comes from the word no.
 Freedom.
 It's so powerful.
 I don't rejuvenate and almost renewed.
 I just felt so welcomed and loved and accepted for who I am and not an ounce of judgment.
 So I was very comfortable there.
 I had a really big impact on me.
 It's going to be worth it.
 It's going to be hard.
 It's going to be even better on the other side.
 For me, it was just a very refreshing and I want to say life giving for me and really was.
 You know, I would go to the next level of life again and probably again and probably again
 because it's so powerful.
 If you want to experience the same kind of life transformation, the same kind of self-awareness
 and freedom that they have or maybe you're just curious what the process would look like
 for you than head on over to crissacrido.com/nextlevellife.
 We are back and speaking of creating space and finding freedom and all that.
 Let me pause here to mention that we are coming up on our 500th episode of the Crissacrido

 Have you signed up?
 I still I'm still building the site, but it's almost done.
 So yes, and I will be the first in line for free stuff.
 I want my swag.
 I don't have any ridge stuff yet.
 So all right, we're back and talking about no using no in the context of setting boundaries
 and we're up to number four.
 Number four is saying no generates respect for oneself, for others as well as protects the heart.
 Saying no reminds myself and others that I'm not a slave and I value true freedom, whether
 it be from addictions, whether it be from work hours, whether it be from relationships.
 Now right before we got to the break, we talked about that God wants us to recognize,
 we honor Sabbath, God wants us to recognize that we're not slaves.
 If you look at the time, God gave the follow this, honor this, set this day aside and honor
 this from creation from the very beginning.
 However, multiple times, there's at least two recorded times that we know of during the
 access.
 What are the Israelites in Egypt during this time?
 Their slaves.
 What is their workload?
 It is so immense.
 They've put this incredible workload on them that they couldn't actually accomplish it.
 So what was their worth to the Egyptians during that time?
 To that Pharaoh, let me say that, to that Pharaoh during that time, their only worth was productivity.
 Yeah, their only worth was productivity.
 I'm speaking to a lot of you out there right now.
 I hope your ears have just kind of lifted up a little bit.
 Hope you're paying attention to what I say because for a whole lot of business, leaders, business
 owners, people, productivity is your greatest worth.
 And I'm going to tell you the King of the Universe disagrees with you, the one who created you
 disagrees with you.
 So if you think about it, here are these people coming out of this slavery, this bondage,
 where their worth is being in bondage, being a slave, what they could actually produce.
 And here's what God says, I'll allow you six days to go and bust it, but you've got to recognize
 that your worth is not your productivity to me.
 I want you to spend time with me.
 I want you to spend time in rest because your productivity is not your worth.
 What do we say at the beginning of the show every single week?
 Business is what you do, not who you are.
 And folks, many of you have got to really, really, really, really get number four.
 Business is what you do, work is what you do.
 Your career is what you do.
 It's one aspect of who you are.
 And if you don't respect yourself to recognize that, then you will be a slave to work.
 You'll be a slave to business.
 I've got to produce more.
 I've got to do more.
 I've got to make more money.
 I've got to make get more clients.
 I've got to whatever it is.
 You will consistently pour out into the thing that you keep telling yourself is your greatest
 worth.
 And by doing so, by not respecting you, guess who you don't respect.
 Everybody else around you.
 Well, those who are winning from you doing this are probably feeling pretty respected, but
 how does your spouse feel, how do your kids feel?
 Do they even remember your name anymore?
 Do they know who you are?
 Have you been so busy doing things that they don't get to spend quality time?
 On top of that, so the disrespect that goes to your family because performing is way more important
 than they are, what's the message you're telling them that performing is more important
 than they are?
 What other messages could you possibly be sending?
 That their worth is in performance.
 So if they don't provide, what's the old song that cat in the cradle?
 That song for decades, you know, I don't know, that thing came out probably in what
 the 60s, maybe the 70s, but that song of this son who keeps trying to spend time with his father
 and his father's always too busy, too busy, too busy, too busy.
 And then later on in life, the father's trying to spend time with the son and the son's
 like I'm too busy, I'm too busy.
 And the whole time is the son's growing up, all he could think of is, gosh, I want to be just
 like my dad.
 Folks, you got to get this number four.
 You got to understand this.
 If you don't say no, it may be a great indicator that you don't respect you.
 If you don't, you know, the first one we mentioned there was addictions, right?
 It can be anything.
 Addictions can be alcohol, drugs, pornography, food, slavery, laziness.
 It could be, you know, procrastination, it could be anything, right?
 If you don't respect yourself enough to go, I'm worth more than this addiction.
 I'm worth more than this slavery.
 I'm worth more than this whatever it is, then you will stay in it.
 You'll stay in it and you'll stay in it and stay in it and stay in it and stay in it.
 One of the things we help people to discover during next level of life is what your true
 worth is and we look at it through the lens of your creator.
 Because until you get that, a lot of times you can't figure out why you're doing the continual
 addiction no matter what it is.
 So a big piece of this is being able to say no to yourself so that you can respect you.
 Yeah, I love that Chris and you know, just looking at two of those things that you mentioned
 together where you talked about work hours and relationships.
 You know, when I say no to working, you know, 15 hour days and I limit myself, I'm saying,
 I respect myself.
 I could be, you know, if I'm married, I'm saying, I respect my partner.
 I respect my children.
 I respect my family because I'm purposefully exercising my will like that point number one.
 We talked about the freedom that comes from exercising the will.
 We discern where true value is.
 We discern.
 We create space around the freedom that it brings us.
 And so I remind myself, I'm not a slave.
 But, you know, there's simple things to when when I get up in the morning, you know, if I'm
 if my eyes open before my alarm does and I don't reach for my phone first.
 But I do something that's important.
 It's an amazing addiction for so many people.
 Oh, I can't tell you, it's one of the most difficult things to master is, you know, what?
 I don't need to see my messages or read through emails sitting in bed before I've spent time
 with the Lord or I've even gotten up to, you know, go to the bathroom, get a couple of
 water, do something for my own heart and sanity.
 And I think that's where that protecting the heart comes in.
 We realize that we're violating ourselves so much because we're refusing to say no to things
 and we become subservient to them and they master us.
 And that can be, you know, the simple addiction of a cell phone.
 But, you know, I respect myself and I respect the Lord when I place those little boundaries
 there.
 And it shows me, wow, there's value here.
 It creates space.
 There's freedom.
 And I get to exercise my will to do that.
 And so again, this is where no as an exercise of the will is one way that I find freedom and
 a sign value and respect to myself and others.
 Yeah, you know, we talk about it.
 I think for you and I, we're believers, we understand the concept of protecting the heart.
 And sometimes I think a lot of people even Christians don't really get what that means.
 And, you know, so for me, I think in it's most basic form as you bring that up.
 I think it's important for people to recognize protecting your heart is keeping things from
 leading you in the wrong directions.
 It's protecting you from going astray.
 It's protecting you from choosing the wrong relationships, the wrong people to hang out with,
 the wrong career, the wrong controlling manipulative people in your life, not putting healthy
 boundaries.
 So everything that we're talking about really does a phenomenal job of helping you to not make
 those decisions and I love that you brought that up because how many times do we not think
 about, you know, we might think about it in the, oh, gosh, I'm going to put this healthy
 boundary in place because this person needs it.
 And then yet what we miss out on is, oh my gosh, my heart needs for me to respect myself enough
 to put in the healthy boundary.
 I need to be good enough to me and one of the things, a lot of people, who, okay, this
 probably going to hurt a few people out there, not hurt, but, you know, emotionally affect,
 how many people out there have not said I'm sorry to myself, you know, have not forgiven
 themselves for things that they've experienced or things that they've done and have not
 spent time protecting their own hearts, right?
 So as we go through that I love that you brought that up because it's such a powerful piece
 of when we say protecting your heart, just think of what all that encompasses, how do I protect
 me from the negativity, from the crap, from the junk, the control, the manipulation, my own
 bad choices, my own addictions, my own, you know, getting worth from man, how do I protect
 me from all of that?
 So saying no is a fantastic way to do so.
 Let me just chime in on that last part real quick about the heart, you know, because as you're
 talking about that, it just comes to mind that, you know, scripture tells us what to think
 on.
 It says think on things that are good, honorable, pure, true, and when I'm saying no to just
 what you were saying that negativity, I'm saying no to the bitterness, I'm saying no to
 reliving moments of stress and trauma and all of this kind of thing, and instead of
 illuminating on that and meditating on that, I choose by an exercise of my will, and I come
 into a place where I'm creating this space of freedom, of discernment, of understanding,
 of placing value and respect.
 In all of that, and I'm choosing the right things instead, man, we start living a different
 kind of life.
 We start getting unstuck from things that have been holding us back, and that's one thing,
 you know, on this podcast, I believe, and I've known you for a long time.
 Now, you know, part of your heart is helping people to get unstuck in life and business.
 And sometimes it's painful, you know, the guardrails and the lines and the boundaries and
 shining light down on situations and learning to say no to things can be difficult,
 but it's unto a greater health.
 It's unto greater freedom.
 It's unto living the life that you are really meant to live.
 And even if it's just something small and petty, like, all right, I'm not going to pick up my
 phone for the first hour.
 I'm going to do things that, you know, really serve me and respect me and give me life so
 that for the rest of the day, I can pour out to other people at so worth it.
 Well, it also, another great thing you just mentioned in there is the thought process, right?
 One of the big things that we help people to do is to battle the lies or slash negative
 self-talk with the truths.
 If you don't respect you enough, many times you won't even battle the own crap that's in
 your own head, the junk that you tell yourself, the lies that you tell yourself.
 If you don't respect you enough and put no in place.
 I tell people, again, I'm a high S, right?
 That's my highest personality style.
 And there's times when I have negative self-talk that I have learned to shut it down so fast
 and one of the ways I do it is just knock it off, stop it, say something in my brain to
 shock it.
 And then I can't stop there after starting pounding truth in there to get that crap out of
 my brain.
 And it's amazing how, and I do this for a living and I try to convince people if you will spend
 time battling that negative self-talk, battling those lies, you could make so much better
 decisions.
 You can see your worth so much better because you have to replace it with the truths.
 What does God say about you?
 What do you see in this word?
 What do you see from a loving father?
 And when you can backfill the whole that's being made from the burning negative self-talk
 or the lies, then you can start filling that up with truths and all of a sudden, I say
 all of a sudden, it's not like it happens in two seconds.
 That's a process.
 You can start going to that positive stuff, a heck of a lot faster.
 And it just becomes a powerful piece of being, again, as you pointed out, respecting you
 enough to exercise your will to solve this in your own mind when you are the one who's not
 telling you the negative self-talk anymore.
 It's amazing the choices that you can make going forward.
 Powerful stuff.
 Good stuff.
 All right, number five, saying no illustrates our boundaries to others who we know and even
 those that we don't know.
 So think about this.
 And we say no, it illustrates our identity, it illustrates our limitations, it illustrates our
 own responsibility to us to others.
 When we put boundaries in place and other people see it and experience it, it helps them
 to recognize who we are.
 It expresses to them this is who I am.
 I shared about my wife having the most phenomenal conversation with our granddaughter on making
 smart choices as a daughter of the most high king, right?
 What would that look like?
 What would those choices be?
 And part of that was, okay, babe, when you're out among other people, so making the choice
 here with Nona is great.
 But what about when you're out there on your own?
 You know, what about when you're out there among your peers?
 How do you say no to illustrate to everybody else?
 This is who I am.
 If they can't accept you for who you are, that's the wrong group.
 It's not who you need to be with.
 There are people in my life.
 I have circles in my life.
 My closest circle are the people who are the healthiest influencers in my life.
 Those are people that influence me in a healthy way, but call my butt out.
 If I'm not doing good stuff, healthy stuff, these are people I listen to when they tell
 me something that's about me.
 I'm able to go, wow, what are they saying?
 Is this truth?
 What do I experience?
 I need to work on that.
 Adjust any of whatever.
 And as my circles go out, the influence lessons.
 So there are people that were great friends of mine decades ago that I spent time with
 and loved on, but about a decade ago, I started making choices saying I can't have that
 person as a in the circle of influence.
 I love that person a death.
 I will go help them.
 I will speak into the lives.
 I will do whatever.
 But this person is making these choices.
 This person is doing this over here.
 It's not sitting there in judgment going, oh, Chris, you're perfect.
 Absolutely the opposite.
 It's me protecting my heart going, hey, dummy, you go in that direction.
 You might make those same decisions too.
 You follow that person, you allow that person to influence you.
 You may be making really bad decisions as well.
 And I don't have people recognize that.
 It's not saying I'm holier than dial.
 I'm better than.
 I'm saying I'm a weak person deep inside.
 You know, scripture tells me, you know, one of the things I praise God for is that he remembers
 I'm weak.
 You know, that I'm not all powerful.
 I'm not all strong.
 That I screw up and I have incredible moments of weakness.
 And I look at the Messiah, the person I'm supposed to try to be like.
 And I see things that Yeshua did that, oh my gosh, how did he even pull that off?
 Do the best I possibly can, but I'm not getting there.
 That's the reason why we needed him, right?
 But I look at some of the apostles and I'm like, how did they make it through that?
 Gosh, I struggle with a small amount of people struggling with me.
 Or attacking me.
 And man, they went through things up a trillion times worse than I did.
 But here's the deal.
 If I will keep focusing on making right decisions, then I can continue to stand.
 And you've done everything you can to stand, stand, keep on standing, right?
 And as you do, it makes you stronger and it makes you make better decisions.
 It doesn't cause you to not love people who are making bad decisions.
 It doesn't cause you to not include them in your life.
 It causes you to be an influencer to them instead.
 Let me try and influence you with my right decisions.
 Let me try and influence you by me doing trying to live a more holy life, a better life.
 Hopefully I can influence you to make better decisions as well.
 Does all of that make sense?
 It's all clear in my head.
 Yeah, yeah.
 No, it's coming through really clear.
 Let me go back to that first one that you mentioned about identity.
 Because I'm thinking about leaders and I'm thinking about parents at home.
 They're in the workplace and something that we've done and I've seen you guys model in the workplace.
 We don't do this around here.
 Or this isn't how we do things.
 We do things like this.
 That's creating culture when we're able to, as I said, saying no illustrates or illuminates
 our boundaries, that defines that identity piece, which is a cultural aspect.
 So we're able to say that in the home, hey, little one, we don't do this here.
 We don't tell lies.
 We don't act this way.
 We don't treat each other just respectfully.
 We love.
 And so we're creating that identity by placing that no as a boundary there.
 We do that in the workplace.
 We do that in some of these spheres of life where we have some ability to speak when we have
 a platform when we have authority to exercise that.
 And it's beautiful how it shows where spaces created for that freedom.
 Once again, the freedom is to operate inside of those lines.
 And still, with this analogy, this metaphor of this car driving on the road.
 When there's limitations, especially for children in the home employees and the workplace.
 So as a leader, when you're saying no and you're creating that cultural identity, that value,
 you're creating a place where they understand how things work and where space has been provided
 to be free.
 And in that freedom, there's life and there's harmony and there's thriving.
 Yeah, you know, we've been talking about this so much as an individual.
 I love that you just pointed out, what is my responsibility for Brian Alex?
 What is my responsibility?
 Yeah, for Neuile Amarino, for all of my team members, for Joel Fortner, what is my responsibility
 for them to feel freedom in our space?
 What is my responsibility to show them that we have the kind of culture that you guys can trust,
 that you guys can believe in, that you can feel the ability to take risks.
 One of the things I can't stand is when people don't allow their team members, there's so much control
 and manipulation and crap going on that team members won't take risks.
 I want risks.
 I love the episodes that you've pulled together in the different directions that we've gone
 and I think have been so powerful because you knew you could take risks.
 This wasn't a thing of like, hey, can I maybe convince you?
 It was a, hey, I think this is the right way to go and it's like, yep, let's do this.
 People need to hear this information.
 So I think that's such a powerful piece as a leader, as a business owner, as a CEO of our company.
 What does it look like for me?
 My responsibility and the great thing is we've just elevated recently, very much deserving
 role for Joel Fortner.
 He's now the president of our company and Aaron West is Vice President and the leadership
 development and just super powerful stuff, fun stuff.
 But part of that is not, the title is not the important thing, right?
 It didn't change.
 I'm still CEO of the business.
 It doesn't change my title.
 It doesn't make me not responsible.
 But one of the things that we're doing is creating more responsibility for other leaders to continue
 to press this down into the rest of the team so that they feel safe, secure, they understand.
 What does it mean for these guys to take on the responsibility for the rest of the team
 members to be able to take risks, to feel freedom, to be able to put boundaries back in place
 if they did something wrong, right?
 So I think that's such a powerful piece again.
 Gosh, I just love this episode.
 So good.
 It's so much important stuff that as we've talked so much about this as the individual, me, the
 individual, one things we have to recognize as me the leader, whether it's in business
 or a parent, if I'm a dad or a mom or grandma or grandpa, what responsibility do I have to
 help those I'm influencing or leading to feel the freedom to say no.
 To feel the freedom to say no.
 I was told this at a level of one of our clients who's a friend of ours and become family as
 well.
 He'll fly down once a month, once every other month and we just go and spend hours together
 coach, we talk family, we talk all kinds of stuff, but his daughters want to come down from
 time to time.
 And I'm a hugger.
 I was not a hugger until I got saved and now I'm a hugger.
 I hug everybody.
 Everybody come and knows.
 Do you love your hugs?
 Well, you love my hugs because I adjust your back.
 Exactly.
 But I'm saying I grew to love your hugs for my own reasons and you know, they are what they
 are, but I love your hugs and I look forward to it.
 Even though I'm not a hugger.
 Yeah, it's it's a good.
 It's okay.
 I remember I'll never forget a time.
 It's like going to come back to that story.
 But another time I had literal rough necks coming in for strap land, literal rough necks.
 Guys that worked on the old rigs and everything and they came in and I always tell people
 hey, when I meet you for the first time, I'll shake your hand, but I'm on a hug
 you and you're leaving.
 And they're like, oh, is that what this is about?
 Oh my gosh.
 Well, you've got this.
 It's ridiculous.
 And so when they left that night, I gave them hugs the next day, gave them hugs.
 The third day they came in, I was on the phone and they walked in the door in something
 amazing happened.
 They were lining up for their hugs.
 Full grown man working on old rigs.
 These guys come from a rough rough life and they realized this is good and this is okay.
 Well, but they, you still have to have boundaries.
 But I tell people, listen, if you don't want it, just tell me no.
 Well, so my buddy comes down and you know, he brings his daughter from time to time and he brings
 his one daughter down.
 And so I just immediately give her a hug of no one for a long time and that I thought to myself,
 oh, I should ask her if that's okay.
 And so when we were leaving, I said, hey, I would love to give you a hug, but it's okay
 if you say no.
 Would you like a hug and she goes, no.
 I'm like, okay, great, fantastic, right?
 And it gave her that ability to say no.
 Now, of course, the next time I see her, she wants a hug.
 But it's okay in that moment.
 I don't think it was more about not wanting a hug.
 I think it was more about messing around with me.
 Either way, it's still the ability to have that boundary.
 Oh, no.
 And that is healthy and that is okay.
 And that's good.
 A healthy result.
 It's great.
 Yeah.
 When do we recognize that our own team members, our spouses, our kids, our grandkids,
 need that ability, that place to be able to put in a healthy boundary, not victim mentality,
 not now I'm not going to do anything, but a healthy boundary.
 So yeah, I love it.
 And it kind of brings us to the, to the introspection part of the show.
 I love this quote.
 I just want to read this by Henry Cloud.
 He's one of the co-authors of the book boundaries that years ago really changed my life
 because there was some situations and relationships that were unhealthy, where there was this
 co-dependence and yeah, things get muddy, things get unclear, where there are no clear boundaries.
 And you were talking about elevating members inside of the business and it just kind of goes
 right along with this where Henry Cloud says, getting to the next level, always requires
 ending something, leaving it behind, moving on.
 And in fact, growth demands that we move on without the ability to end things people stay stuck,
 never becoming who the hair meant to be, never accomplishing all the their talents and abilities
 should afford them.
 And that's exactly, you know, whether it's, we're talking about people being elevated in a
 position to have more responsibility, take on a role where they're responsible for others, they're
 able to grow into something, become who they're meant to be, you know, whether we're talking
 about that in the workplace or we're talking about you.
 And I mean, you know, who's listening right now, what is something that you need to end,
 that you need to leave behind, that you're thinking as you've been listening over the last
 hour, I need to be moving on here so that I can grow.
 We're talking about health.
 We're talking about freedom.
 We're talking about value and respect.
 We're talking about very, very healthy things.
 So where are you stuck?
 And you're being held back from becoming what you were meant to be.
 This word.
 So small.
 So insignificant.
 Get such a bad rap.
 But here is so many positive, powerful things about this little word, no, that could be your
 key to going to the next level.
 Yeah.
 Well, Warren Buffett said one time, the difference between successful people and very successful people
 is that very successful people say no, two almost everything.
 Now you really have to rumenate on that for a little bit to get that.
 You can be successful in business and life.
 But if you're not saying no to a lot of things that are important that you say no to, if
 you say yes to way too many things, then that success is not going to be a great amount
 of success.
 Now, let me throw the caveat on that this is through the lens of Warren Buffett.
 So his lens of success is not the same lens as my success, not most likely not the same lens
 as God's success.
 But take that into what does it mean to be very successful in your relationship with God?
 What does it mean to be very successful in your relationship with your spouse, your kids,
 your team members and so on and so forth.
 If I'm going to be very successful, one of that we talked about productivity, let me tell you
 parents, leaders who believe your worth is productivity when your kids don't know who you are
 because you spend so much time working or you come home and you're on your phone or your computer
 or whatever, then you have to understand your level of success is what you produce, not what
 you have been given, how you take care of what you've been given.
 When we stand before God, I say this all the time, whatever I say this is a strap plan,
 or next level of astamon retreat, we just had a great retreat.
 People always laugh because they know it's true, none of us are getting to heaven and God's
 going to go, I am so impressed with how much money you made.
 Gosh, you're amazing.
 That's not going to happen.
 He's going to ask you, what did you do with the daughter I gave you with the son I gave you?
 What did you do with the spouse I gave you?
 What did you do with the grandkids?
 What did you do with the opportunities I gave you?
 I think that's the important thing for us to recognize.
 If you want to be very successful in the eyes of God, there's a whole lot of crap you got to
 say no to.
 Maybe, you know, grab in your phone first thing in the morning or it may be TV, it may be bad
 influences and bad friends, it may be healthier physical situations, choosing better food
 options and so on and so forth, whatever it is, recognize that if you want to be very successful,
 you can find life in business that you really want.
 The key is that it's located on the other side of no healthy, no.
 So thank you for a great discussion, Brian.

 Really needed to happen and I'm really glad we got to talk to you this great job
 brother.
 I appreciate it.
 I enjoyed it and I'm taking away a lot from the conversation as well.
 I think, you know, we talked so much about boundaries and it was really good to dive in deep
 dive on what healthy boundaries could actually look like and the freedom that's waiting
 for you on the other side of that little word, no.
 Absolutely.
 Absolutely.
