 The weeds in your garden that are keeping you from clarity in your communication that is coming up next
 Welcome to the Christmas Cardo Show where we discuss leadership and life and discover that business is what you do not who you are
 Hey folks hope you're having a fabulous week question for you. How's your garden coming along?
 That doesn't sound weird at all. Of course I'm talking about the garden of communication
 That we've been dealing with the weeds that get in the way of great communication now
 last week we got as far as weed number one, which was that our position with other people
 informs our disposition towards them so if I'm always focused on my position
 What do I care about yours?
 Right if I'm somebody who's incredibly self-protective or defensive
 I'm really not gonna care about your position, right if I'm somebody who's losing worth and the situation and the
 Communication in relationship. I'm not gonna care about your position
 But if I'm gonna get the clarity then many times I need to
 Remove myself for my position and try and put myself in your position
 So this can be a very dangerous thing when we hold on to weed number one, which is our position
 So on to weed number two, which is our intention now Stephen Calby says most people do not listen with the intent to understand
 They listen with the intent to reply. Oh my gosh
 That is so incredibly true now. That's not everybody
 There's many of us that actually spend time listening to people some of us do it for a living
 To understand to grow to learn to gain better perspective and I'm not saying that I haven't listened to reply
 I've had many of those situations in my life as well, but here's what we need to understand
 When we're listening to reply
 We're not listening to the other person. Yes, we're hearing the words that they're saying yes
 We know what they're roughly talking about but what we're listening for is to inject us is to give
 Wisdom or knowledge or opinion or criticism or whatever, right?
 So when you're listening to others in a relationship and your intention is that you're listening so that you can give information
 Then you're not listening for clarity
 You're not focusing on having the best possible communication
 You're focusing on what you get to say
 Another thing is is that when we're not listening intentionally
 We're spending time formulating your response think about this
 If you're focusing on being able to inject your information then you're also coming up with it while you're listening
 So instead of being able to actually give quality input or get quality clarity
 What you're focusing on is formulating a response as they're still talking
 Which means you're really not listening very well to the thing that they're saying
 If it's about you giving
 Information then it's definitely not about you getting
 Information think about that for a second if
 We're not gonna get clarity in communication
 Do you think your input's gonna help?
 Do you think you just waiting to respond is actually gonna bring greater clarity?
 Nope, it is not another thing is when we are not listening with the intention to gain clarity in communication
 many times we're insisting on our
 opinions
 Instead of gaining quality perspective from the other person
 Because our intention is to reply our focus becomes incredibly on what our opinions are
 Many times those are our criticisms as well
 Ouch think about that right if you're somebody who listens to criticize
 Well then there's a really good chance
 You're not benefiting the communication at all
 So this is all selfish and it impairs our ability to understand what's really being communicated
 So without clarity and understanding we allow mis-understanding to grow now Steven Koby continues by saying
 If I were to summarize in one sentence the single most important principle
 I have learned in the field of interpersonal relations you would be this
 seek first to understand
 Then to be understood when we come back we're gonna hit weed number three right up to this
 Hey, it's Joel Fortner here. I'm device president a leadership development on Chris's team and I oversee our next level mastermind business coaching program

 All right weed number three
 If we're going to cultivate our garden we've got to get these weeds out we've got to get we've got to fix these things if we're gonna
 Make sure that we have clarity in communication
 Number three is our attention
 So misunderstanding is just one form of confusion that breeds other weeds
 Think about that we've distract us from the question that is being asked or the context that it's already in
 I cannot tell you how many times and I've done this myself, but I cannot tell you how many times
 I've been communicating to somebody and they are really not focused on the thing that I'm saying there are
 certain people I will watch that if I'm talking to and
 They're on their phone
 Then I will say I need your attention, please. Oh, you've got my attention. Okay
 When you're done doing what you're doing then I can continue with this, right?
 There are times that you will see somebody is writing something or they're working on their computer or whatever it is and
 their full attention is not on you
 Well, that is usually if the if the
 Information is important that's usually when I will just wait
 I'll just stop talking and wait until I have their actual attention. Why?
 Because in my many years of communicating to people there have been many times that somebody has been
 Distracted while telling me that I have their attention only to find out later on
 They forgot they didn't understand or they never heard the thing that I said
 There are times that I could go back and go
 What did you do with the thing about the thing and you know we talked about this we didn't talk about that?
 Yeah, yeah, we know we sure did. No, we didn't we never talked about that. No, we did you just happen to have been on your phone when we talked about it
 So next time let's make sure you're not on your phone
 That has happened many times and guilty has charged there have been plenty of times that I have done that myself
 If we are distracted
 Then we have an attention
 Defacet this is a huge weed and most people's communication
 Not only that
 But it's rude
 It is incredibly rude now again. I will tell you in my early days of leadership
 When I was running just
 90 to nothing non stop meetings meetings events all kinds of stuff all day long into the night working on the weekends
 All it work in like crazy just couldn't stop
 I would tell people hey listen when you come to talk to me if you're you know
 If I'm working on something I've got my door open you can come and talk to me
 But if you really need my attention come grab me by the face and say I need you to focus on this right?
 So there was many times people come in and just want to say higher
 You know give me information on something and you know in those early days
 I would might keep working. I did keep working
 Because it wasn't something that needed me to stop and focus on them
 But when they needed my attention then they knew to say hey can I get your attention for a second?
 Yes, absolutely what he got this this and this okay fantastic great
 But if I did not give them the right to say I need your attention
 Then what could happen is they could tell me something very important and if I wasn't paying great attention to it
 I missed it right
 The distraction is an attention deficit
 We teach our team to train their focus on what's actually going on in the conversation
 It shouldn't be on something else it shouldn't be on a phone it shouldn't be on a computer
 It shouldn't be on the birds flying by outside it shouldn't be on any that stuff what should it be on
 The other person
 Three things that we teach them to do is one watch the other person's body language
 Why this feeds us all kinds of information anybody who's coming in the next level of life or strap-land knows
 We watch your body language we're paying attention why because your communicating things to us
 That help us to know where you are in the moment if we see that your fidgety we can say that something that we're discussing right now
 Is causing you to feel uncomfortable if we see that you are
 I don't want to give away all of our secrets but if there's a certain posture you're with us if that if the posture is opposite
 You're not with us
 There's a struggle if all of a sudden we see frustration it's either going to be in something that you just heard something you experience or something
 They've come from a past situation whatever it is
 What we're looking for is how is the person responding with their body?
 I've had people sit at a table
 Saying something above the table
 But then when I looked under the table you could see these feet going like crazy these hands being wrenched and
 Their response was considerably different our I remember doing an event
 Where one of the team members turned to the rest of the table and was saying something
 That their body did not align with and so when they finished talking in fact the thing that they had said was is
 I'm not afraid of anything and there's nothing I'm concerned about there's nothing I'm worried about
 And when they stopped I said hey
 Help me to understand because
 When I look at your hands you can't stop ringing your hands and your feet are going ballistic and that person just sat back and was like
 Okay, so here's what I'm worried about
 I mean it was just like a idiot. This is they they spit it right out right, but they just finished saying
 I'm not afraid of anything
 Yeah, you are
 How do we know because I can look at your body language and it's communicating?
 I actually don't love this. This is not something I like I'm unhappy with this and once I asked it was just asking you know
 Hey, this is what I'm seeing
 So is what you just said actually truth? No, it is not here is the truth
 So we teach our team watch the person's body language trying to understand what's being communicating in the moment another thing is
 listen to how
 The person is communicating now I
 Recognize because of a situation that happened with me
 Years ago back in the 90s when I was working logistics
 I had sent a message to somebody on what was called a Qualcomm now this was a
 Big box the size of what would later be
 Considered a laptop, but this was just a big box that had like a two inch wide by one inch tall screen and you literally read
 The characters as they scrolled across so hopefully the word fit inside of the screen if it did not yet to keep reading it like a ticker tape
 and
 I had somebody who came to me and
 I mean traveled
 by distance
 Along ways to come to me and find out why I was upset with them
 I mean like I think a few hundred miles and I
 Talk to that person I said what are you talking about they're like why are you upset with me? I'm like I'm not upset with you
 And then I quote what you sent me
 Show that you were upset and when they showed it to me I said no that right there means this
 And the person said you know my wife said I was reading that incorrectly
 But it made a huge point to me something I communicated
 Was not clear enough that the person did not understand that I was not upset with them
 From that point on this is back in the mid 90s from that point on that affected my
 Communication I started changing the way that I communicated I started making sure that I was more clear now later on when we had things like you know
 The ability to put in 14 exclamation points behind something I would put those in to make sure that somebody knew or
 Smiley faces so that somebody knew that I was actually happy I was communicating something in a joyous way
 Because I didn't want to communicate something that didn't come across the right way, right? Well, guess what?
 Even today in today's emails in today's text
 It's very easy for us to communicate something social media hello. It's very easy for us to communicate something and the tone is not heard
 We don't hear the tone we don't hear the demeanor and so we can very quickly
 misunderstand so when you are listening to somebody
 You want to make sure that you're listening for the tone
 You want to make sure that you're checking out what their demeanor is
 All right, so what are you hearing?
 What does it you know? What is it a quake to what do you experience in the conversation that's coming through their tone?
 Do they sound frustrated? Do they sound angry? Do they sound confused? Do they sound self-protecting defensive?
 Do they sound like they're losing worth? Do they sound like they're trying to gain worth?
 You know all of these things are things for you to be focusing on to make sure that you're giving your attention
 to what's coming from the signs that the other person is giving
 If you hear a tone that sounds off and you're paying attention you can question it
 You can push back, right? But if we're not paying attention we can either completely miss it or automatically assume
 The worst so another thing that we teach is notice when someone is deflecting or reframing the conversation, right?
 So quite often people will hear me say hey that didn't answer the question
 Can you answer the question for me? There's many times when especially in strap land
 When we're pushing on something and somebody starts to deflect
 That I will say hey that didn't actually answer the question and they get this big smile on their face because they know
 Yep, I was trying not to answer the question
 If you're listening to when somebody is deflecting
 Quite often what will happen is when somebody feels that they're about to lose worth or they're about to be in trouble or they're about to
 You know be unhappy
 Or be caught in something that they're saying what you will see is they tend to deflect from either the question or
 The direction you went in many times they will reframe the whole conversation to be something else
 So there's times you're talking about one subject and they will bring up a different subject and
 Point that at you and now you're responding to the thing that they're pointing at you
 Well, what happened to the thing we were talking about
 Right so one of the things that we teach our team is
 In moments like that pull the person back to the original conversation
 Yes, I understand that that's great, but here's the thing we're trying to solve right here
 Can you still you know, I still need to get you to answer this question over here or I need to understand why this is happening the way that it's happening
 Pull them back to that original conversation
 even it could happen like five times
 They could keep trying to deflect trying to reframe
 Many many times
 Keep pulling them back if you can do that then it will help you to have much greater clarity
 On the communication that's happening in the moment, right?
 So understand that sometimes people are uncomfortable sometimes people feel like they're losing worth
 You know those are reasons why they might deflect and the moment so this provides
 Incredibly useful information, but it demands our full attention
 When we're communicating if we are not giving our communication then none of that stuff matters. So
 To sum up here are the three weeds again the first one is position
 Notice your posture towards someone else when conversing are you
 Valuing and respecting others regardless of what your position is
 Whether you are somebody who's older somebody who's in leadership somebody who is the parent whatever it is
 Make sure that you're checking your position and try putting yourself in their shoes number two
 Intention
 Intentionally slow down breathe
 Listen to what's being said are you seeking first to understand
 Before being understood or are you spending time
 Waiting to jump in and give your opinion if your intention is about you
 I can promise you your your communication will not be good number three attention
 Give others your full
 full full full full full
 Attention if you want to be fully understood are you valuing the communication in the person in the moment or you just focused on the thing you want to be focused on
 So problems force says
 though it costs you all you have
 Get understanding
 Folks, I hope this has helped you today to gain much greater clarity in your communication. I hope this has helped you today to have much better relationships
 It is gonna take your effort to make sure that you're not doing these things then to make sure that you're
 Weeding these things out of your communication garden
 The sooner you do the better relationships you will have
 Well as always we want you to take this information change your leadership change your business change your life and
