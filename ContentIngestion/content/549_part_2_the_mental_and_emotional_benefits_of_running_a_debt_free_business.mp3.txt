 On today's episode, this is coming from a heart of a teacher who has
 Counciled
 Many people through this process. So I just wanted to throw that out there if if many of you are already like
 I'm like, I don't want to listen to this. I'm not getting anything from it. I promise you you will. So with that being said
 The mental and emotional benefits of running a debt free business that is coming up next
 [Music]
 Welcome to the Crystal Cardo Show where we discuss leadership and life and discover that
 business is what you do not who you are. Welcome to the show folks. I hope you're having a
 fabulous day wherever you are. We're having a great day here joining me in studio is the great
 but I got to come up with new ways of describing you the great and yeah you need a larger set of agitus.
 Yeah more agitus fluffy no that wouldn't work out. Funny that works out
 loving and caring Joe forna. I am I am softer these days. I feel like I have inherited the
 dad bod like in my 30s and 40s. Like I'm really good at it. Like I'm very good dad bod.
 I am fluffy. Fluffy is accurate. Yeah well joining me is Joe forna because we are on part two
 of our episode of discussing what is it like the emotional and mental benefits of running a debt free
 business. So welcome back to the showman. Did you have your back? Yeah thank you so much. So if you
 did not listen to part one make sure that after you listen to today's go back and listen to that
 because we got into an hours worth of what I felt like was really good information
 that will set a lot of the stage in the background for even today's continued conversation.
 So again if you haven't listened to part one go back and listen to it. We got into the mental
 emotional benefits of running a debt free business that also includes just being a leader or a team
 member within a business is that's very applicable to you and then how much we got into just really it's
 the unintended consequences of debt. We got into debt into debt into all of that. So we're going
 to continue our conversation. So if you're a good Chris why don't we just dive right in because I've got
 a question that I wanted to ask you last time but we just didn't have time for it. So here's the thing.
 So years ago you put out this video, we put out this video called go after your passions and we left
 the conversation in part one talking about these kind of things and you were giving advice on well
 if I'm living in this crappy situation in my work life and I want to go start my own thing and I'm
 about passionate about what I do now and I'm passionate about this thing and I want to go do that
 and I'm going to have to go into debt. So like shouldn't I go after my passions? I mean isn't life
 short? I mean shouldn't I shouldn't I do that? And there's not that a line with what you said years ago
 and that video you put out? No. Crits me if I'm wrong. But in that video we talked about how going after
 your passion should never override smart decision making should never override taking care of your four
 walls putting a roof over your head and food on the table. Don't cut off your nose to spite your face
 by running out and going after your passions. I'm all about you going after your passions but one of the
 things that I greatly learned from Daniel Lappin is is that if you are doing the thing that God's
 called you to do you will eventually become passionate about it. Now I'm not saying if you are you know
 if you have passions that you can go make money doing in their legal and their wholesome morally
 okay. Great do it bust it but the thing that and I think that you're a lute and I don't think what you
 are looting to is that people use this as an excuse to go into debt you said it again because it's the
 way we've heard people say forever never I have to go into debt. You never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
 ever have to go into debt you don't have to do this that is a choice you don't have to go into debt right
 well what if I was in the world's worst situation I didn't have anything when I was going to give you
 dead anyways so there isn't a justifying of I have to do this you don't have to go into debt to
 do your passions. The crazy thing is is I have been in many businesses throughout my life many different types of
 industries and coachings and teachings and what we do today is my passion. This is a bit was a big
 part of my passions I have many passions so all those things that I did beforehand to put food on the table
 and stay at a debt and you know recover from stupid and all that kind of stuff led to it because I was
 following what God was telling me to do there's so many times I heard him say you know turn left turn right
 don't go anywhere you know I stayed in one industry for five I mean it seemed like I was in there forever
 and I hated it and you know I knew that God is so funny I knew that God wasn't calling me away yet
 and then all of a sudden you know I had a bunch of the folks that were friends of mine people I was
 in ministry with that are going you just need to leave that job and you just need to get out of there and I'm like
 God still hasn't called me away and then all of a sudden I felt this I should go do a resume this is
 years into the process and I hadn't done a resume in years and so I went to a friend's house this is
 back in the days of dot matrix printers and I didn't own a computer and she did and she did up all my
 resume on her computer and pressed print on the keyboard and went out to this dot matrix printer
 and the moment she pressed the button everything inside of me said you're not sending that out and I was like
 oh my goodness I said hey I am so sorry but I feel like God just told me I'm not supposed to send this out
 and she's like oh okay well I mean if that's what God's telling you and I just knew I'm not supposed
 to send this out two weeks later I have this conversation with a gal in our office who hated God
 turned her back on God didn't believe in God because her son and law killed her grandchildren
 and this conversation came up about that and I said hey can we go on the office and just talk
 about this and after a couple of hours of talking about it she's in tears I'm in tears and she's
 receiving God again and putting her focus on God changing her life towards God. Well I walked out and went
 back to my desk and as I sat down on my desk the phone rang and I picked it up and it was a guy who used
 to work for me and that same place goes hey there's a company that knows about you and wants to
 hire you do you have a resume not kidding those are his words. Well I just happened to have one and he
 goes well can you fax it on over so I faxed it on over and I got the job obviously went through
 the hiring process. What is my point of sharing all of that you know in that if what you're hearing is
 Chris you're stupid for staying in a in a place that you know you hate because I was somewhat
 in tune with God I knew I wasn't supposed to leave yes I hated it couldn't stand it didn't like it
 at all I was really good at it but didn't like it that one I stuck around following God's will not
 Chris has had one conversation which turned at least that woman back to God who knows who else maybe your
 daughter maybe other family members maybe your husband I don't know had that one conversation and
 literally seconds afterwards God was moving me from that place to a different place so what is my
 point if you're leaving just because you don't like it you're not following the right process are you on your
 knees you know worshiping God in prayer you know are you lowering yourself before the king of the
 universe in prayer finding out what he wants what if he doesn't want you to leave yet that goes against
 everything that seems you know just logical and intellectual inside of us why would God want me to stay
 in a crappy situation because he may have one conversation that he wants you to have so first aspect of
 you know while I want to go follow my passions follow God and he will give you things that you will become
 passionate about well I really love this thing over here okay can you immediately go and make money
 at it right now no I have to go into debt then don't do it is God calling you no then stay right
 where you are until he tells you where to go you know if you don't feel anything at all you know maybe
 you're in a position where you're not in tune with God you're not hearing him say anything one way or another
 make a decision go do what you think you should do go do what you think God would be happy with you doing
 but that's always going to be my first area focus I mean I own this business
 we're 10 years strong successful fantastic changing lives doing amazing things and I'm always constantly
 asking God are we doing what you want is this what you want do you want to change anything do anything different
 you know whatever why because the last thing I want is that he's saying to me turn right and I'm still
 saying no I gotta keep doing the same thing I gotta keep doing what I'm doing and I missed out on
 him saying turn right so Chris what do you say to the person that that believes you know like in the
 business world it's competitive there's tons of people doing business and how am I really going to ever
 get ahead or compete if I can't do debt because it's like you know like listening to part one of
 this episode you talked about you know the story you often tell about the tacos stand and like you
 have it this too slow I can't get ahead I can't compete it's just and I want to I want to go
 on passionate about this it's like I don't want to look up in 10 years and I've still got a two-wheel
 taco stand on the sidewalk yeah if I can be allowed to punch you in the throat and I really I really
 really really really really want you to listen to me right now and I really want you to do your best to
 understand what I'm saying I want this to be something that's painful for you you should never
 ever ever go into business to compete that should never be your focus there are way too many of our
 followers our clients the people listening to the show people that we know people out in the world
 that are spending their time comparing themselves to other people to other businesses and God never wanted
 them to we have close close friends that have been in business for a long time that it took us a
 while to help them to stop comparing themselves to you know somebody else who was in business in their
 area who was what appeared to be wildly more successful than they are your success is not based on what
 somebody else is doing you know it's interesting in the Hebrew there's no word for hero
 because you're not supposed to be an example of somebody else you're supposed to be the example of your
 Shoah you're supposed to be you know his Hebrew name Jesus is the name that most people call him but his actual name is
 Yeshua you're not supposed to be like anybody but him you are an individual that got his made you're supposed
 to be the best version of yourself so you know people asked us early on you know who's your competition and I always
 always said we don't have any competition first off nobody really does what we do the way that we do it so
 that's one aspect other tons of people in the leadership world that are Christian based absolutely
 but we're not in competition with a single one of them we believe and we have an abundance mindset again
 you know I referenced Daniel Appan on the last show again his concept that he says that people think that
 money is like a piece of cake or a whole cake and if I get a bigger piece of that cake there's
 less for you and he says that's not God's economy God's economy is like the light on the candles on top of the cake
 I can always light your candle with my light it doesn't matter how much I get that's not the focus right
 there's there's too many aspects around that so when we look at this concept of well I have to be
 in competition I have to do better than my competition oh my gosh my neighbor is doing better than I do
 his BMW's better than my BMW their house is bigger than mine you know this concept of keeping up with
 the Jones is you know comparing myself to we have clients that are massively bigger than us right we have
 you know one of our biggest clients hundred fifty million dollars right but when they came to us
 they were fifty million in thirty years or twenty five years and after doing what we helped them
 to do they want to hundred million and three years should I look at them and go well cred we should
 be a hundred hundred fifty million dollar business no no that's not our goal I'm not in competition
 plus they they're a power company they don't do the same stuff we do there's no competition there right
 so whenever somebody gets this concept of competition comparing themselves to others all that
 that is screaming that your worth is absolutely tied up in your belief system and your belief system
 is that you've got to be as good as somebody else when I left Dave's it was because I was called to
 God called me to start this business and the interesting thing is I knew I knew that I that was where my
 heart was my heart was did I love being on the stage in front of you know thousands of people
 sure absolutely but only because I was hopefully teaching people to change their lives coming this direction
 we're making a huge impact working one on one with individuals or businesses and stuff like this
 massive right but even when I started this business every now and then there'd be this thought
 my mind oh I've got to build a platform really fast and I would go no that is not while you're here
 that is not what you're doing it's not about a stinking platform nobody cares about I don't care about that
 God doesn't care about that you do what God's leading you to do so that's my throat punch
 if competition is your goal you are gonna find you're gonna be severely let down
 so in part one of this discussion you talked a lot about risk and about mitigating risk and how much
 you add risk to your life when you do debt but isn't if you are just a cash-based is debt-free
 company aren't you just assuming a lot of risk there too and like and then so that's one but then
 it's like how do you if you encounter difficult circumstances like you're going to encounter in business
 anyway how do you get yourself out if all you have maybe is your own cash and your own money it may be
 what you do for a living isn't really crazy profitable so it's not a ton of money going to the bottom line
 so maybe there's not a lot not can pull from to solve a problem that I'm gonna run into like how
 to business owners and business leaders navigate that yeah so to the first part of that yes there's
 risk in any business there's risk in waking up this morning there's risk in walking outside there's
 risk in getting in your car there's just get anything right the concept of running a debt-free
 business compared to a leverage to business is that the risk is mitigated you have considerably less
 risk why because you own everything and so if things go wrong if you've done a good job of
 covering yourself with insurance and you've done a good job of you know making sure you're doing the best thing
 you possibly can then when things go wrong if they do go wrong and you let's say you lose everything
 you go to zero you don't go to well I still owe three million dollars right that's the that's the
 ridiculous part about this is people think oh well things go about I'll be good to go no you'll still
 owe the money and if your out is well I can file bankruptcy man I would say you need a deeper walk with
 God right so is there risk of course there for risk there's just in any adventure there's risk in any
 business but for me I take calculated risks I calculate what we're going to do you tax the
 collective intelligence of our leaders and our team and pull stuff together and we sit down and we
 ask the question how could this fail what would it look like if it did is this something we're passionate
 about we feel like it's going to change people's lives you know all on that stuff you're taxed with
 you make sure that stuff happens well you make sure that the team is operating in and right decision
 making is the risk of course there is but when things go bad once again like we talked about in
 last episode COVID we didn't lay a single person off we didn't you know and I listen this is not
 judgment of people who add to it was a really ridiculous difficult time my point is nobody got laid off
 nobody lost their pay we didn't decrease anybody's pay we rocked on all the way through the year
 and then because we did and we kept serving our clients like crazy everything came back for us
 and we did phenomenally well so is there risk absisting can loot me it's just a terrible what is it a
 straw man statement is that what you consider a straw man statement or there's risk in everything yes
 but that's that is cutting out the concept of mitigating your risk by not having the debt in the first place
 I've got if I've got cash I've paid for everything right now if we sold everything out of the business
 in chain we're doing pretty good you know the last thing I want to do is do that but if things go south
 in our business geez we've got assets we've got you know there's all kinds of stuff that we still have
 that is a terrible end to something we love to do but by gosh we would make it through
 the second thing is you know what about the profit aspect what if I don't have a lot of profit okay
 I'm gonna hit you with the goddess back again if God has called you to something it's not going to fail
 not is that mean that God's gonna bless you with millions of dollars of net profit not at all
 but I do want you to understand if God's called you to it he's gonna find a way for it to be successful
 if it's not being successful there's two questions I would ask did God call me to this and I
 sitting or doing something that's keeping this from being successful and my the one who's holding this thing back right
 so if God wants it to happen he's got he can make it happen if you were running into low profit
 situations and you're saying to yourself this thing just isn't that profitable then are you reaching
 out to people who actually know how to run a business are you putting people around you you know one of the
 great things about our mastermind program and it didn't mean this to turn into a sales pitch it's really not
 but the thing that's so phenomenal is that we have people running businesses and leaders of businesses
 that are spending time with other people who do what they do even if it's in a completely different industry
 you know we just had a retreat not too long ago and everybody's sitting out at night time and that
 you after dinner and fire place you know fire pit going and people playing cornhole and all that the
 discussions how many times do we hear people say I need this I always need this time I get to hang out
 with people who are experiencing the things I'm experiencing because how many people when you run a
 business or you're a leader in a business how many people do you know intimately you know that you're
 close enough with that are actually going through the same stuff you're going through or who've
 been through it or somebody you can help you can lift them up right so this concept of well the thing just
 isn't that profitable are you surrounding yourself with people who know what the heck they're talking
 about or is your cousin Eddie telling you how to run your business and giving you all the
 suggestions that he has and he's never done it owned a business or been a leader a day in his life
 right so I would really question is God called me to this am I doing stupid that's holding me
 back from God blessing do I have the proper influence into my life that's helping me to make the right
 decisions those are the ways that I would think through them okay so let's say I'm soul you've sold me
 all right you've handled all my objections to that um Chris I'm way too in debt how do I get out of this
 how do I get myself out of this because this seems like this is going to take a long time
 where do I start so the first thing that you have to do my suggestion is that you make sure that you are
 operating your accounting well if you don't understand what you're making and where it's going
 and what your actual profit is then it's going to be insanely difficult for you to get out of debt so
 and for me we teach a lot of the same stuff you know if you ever follow financial peace university
 damn Ramsay stuff we apply a lot of that to the business as a person's getting out of debt do you have
 an emergency fund do you have a cash in case things go wrong if you don't and you start paying off debt
 then guess what something goes wrong you're screwed you're going to have to continue to go further
 into debt to solve that thing if you've got you know I personally prefer six months of operating
 expenses if you have like in case you have no business what does that mean so for some people I remember
 I was talking to two gals cash probably about 12 years ago and they're like six months we operate a
 concrete plant do you know what the expenses are like no ladies six months as if you have no concrete
 business whatsoever like oh last not much at all it's like yeah okay so we're not talking about the
 expenses that you're going to need as if you were still running the business we're saying let's say sales
 just completely stopped one kaput you got no sales coming in which means you don't have to put
 expense in two materials and things like that you just need to keep the doors open what is the
 bare minimum to keep the doors open have that for six months so in case your your business just tanked
 you can keep the doors open for six months if you've got that in place then I would do you know
 the same kind of concept as Dave would teach on the debt snowball I would list my debts smallest the largest
 and I would pound I would do minimums on everything and pay you know the largest amount on that
 smallest debt and I would go ballistic I would go crazy now a lot of folks tend to ask us do I start
 on my personal debt or my business debt do I start on my house or do I start on my brick and mortar
 of my office and I'm gonna tell you a great way of asking or answering that question is if you were to
 lose something which would you rather lose would you rather lose your personal home but you still got a
 you know a business to go to or would you rather lose that business and you've got a home that is yours
 that you own so for me as a business owner I'm gonna try and pay off my if what we're talking about
 as you own both the business debt and the personal debt let's say your you know individual owner
 then I'm gonna try and well even if you were partners I'd still have this discussion which partnerships suck
 don't do them you know I'm gonna try and pay off my personal debt as fast as I possibly can
 and get myself in a position to pay off the business debt as fast as I possibly can so that's my way
 of doing it I would list those debts smallest the largest I would pound the smallest debts with everything
 that I have available that is not needed to go towards more business so does that mean that you know I'm not
 don't shut down your marketing that's the thing that's bringing you in new business and new
 new leads and new money so that you can pay off the debt because what you're gonna find out is you're
 gonna have no more profit right so continue operating the business in the way that's working but if you've
 got any spending that's going to places that is unnecessary and it's just luxury and it's it's so not needed
 cut it off get rid of it and focus it on this debt as fast as you possibly can as you pay those down
 then just roll over the payment from you know the the big bulk on that small one onto the next
 smallest payment or smallest debt and just keep working your way up what you'll find as you'll get
 be out of debt heck of a lot faster than you thought you would so that's how I would logically start
 focusing getting out on debt the big piece missing here is again you've heard me hit it 14 times in
 these two shows is the god piece go to god and talk through this talk to god about what he wants talk
 to god about what it should look like if you will do that if you will spend time talking through with god
 and ask him he will guide and direct you if you will find out and I will preach this from now until he
 returns you know if you are focusing on being obedient to him in the ways that he desires
 then you will find he will offer you much more blessings every time god shares his revelation with people
 it's because he knows that he can trust that they're going to follow his ways and they're going to teach
 other people to do it as well so is there things that you're missing out on in your relationship you
 walk with god if you will if you will really check that or talk to somebody like us and we can help you
 to get there right to get to that truth so those are aspects of what I would do to get out of debt
 please don't try to continue going after debt opportunities because you think it's going to make you
 all the money to pay off the debt that you're trying to pay off right make smart decisions
 the sooner you get out of debt if you think if you just calculate how much money are we servicing on
 debt every single month think of what that looks like you know for people there's a lot of folks
 out there it's tens of thousands of dollars for some folks it maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars right
 think about how much money you're servicing on debt when you get done with the debt that money
 is yours it's yours think of how much money as a business owner you're taking home to take care of
 the debt that you have at home when you pay that off that money is yours right so when I started this
 business I didn't have to take money out of this business I had plenty of money so I just kept
 folding the money back into the business for many many years of just I don't need this money I can just
 leave it right here well if you don't have debt at home you don't have to take home as much money what
 you'll find is is like if you cleared up all your debt at home you'd be surprised that how much money
 you don't have to take out of your business I'm not saying live on a shoe string budget what I'm
 saying is is that it would help your business let's say you were able to take 20 thousand dollars
 less of your home because you didn't you got rid of all your debt at home you can then use that
 to service your business debt and then when it's gone you can take more money out right there's all kinds of
 things you can do to make smart decisions so several times in this two-part series you've referenced
 to go to God pray go to God talk to God there's a lot of people who say I don't ever hear from God Chris
 I have prayed I've been on my knees I've just I've I don't hear from God but what do you say to
 that person that's like I don't know if that's going to help me in this situation the difficulty in hearing
 God is that we always think that he's just going to respond to us and the way that we want to hear
 we assume that hearing God means I need to have this audible voice that tells me exactly what to do
 I will say do I feel like I have heard from God many times in my life absisting can literally I do
 I remember the very first time I felt like I heard it wasn't expecting to and I just heard his voice
 and it sounded a heck of a lot like my voice inside of my head but it was clear and it was focused on
 his stuff I always say you know if you can argue with the voice inside your head it's probably not
 you it's probably God because you can't argue with you you can reason with you but you can't argue with you
 the second thing to understand is is that if that voice inside of your head is ever going against God's ways
 it sure is heck is not God God's not going to tell you to go into debt God is not going to tell you to
 go into debt God doesn't tell you to go into debt just understand that right so when people say oh God's
 tell me to go do this big business and I have to go $3 million in debt that didn't come from God that goes against
 this word God doesn't contradict them so so understand you may not be hearing him in a way that
 you recognize and it's very possible if you don't have a great relationship with him and walking with him
 and putting him first and and being obedient to him you may not be hearing him it's it's very possible
 the second thing is is that you have to understand that God speaks through his word immensely
 so much you know people who don't believe in God you know or say well I don't believe in the
 Bible I don't believe God made the Bible happen well if God's not big enough to make scripture happen
 he's not big enough to be the king of the universe he's not big enough to be the God who made 3.2
 billion bits of code in your DNA if he can't make a single book work out you know then he's not a big
 enough God so for me I'm always looking for what is God telling us through scripture what is he speaking to me
 you know and if I follow his biblical aspects of running a business oh my gosh the Bible is full
 of how I should run a business how I should treat people how I should act how I should care for my
 customers how I should care for my vendors there is a ton in there about how to run your business
 so much of what we speak is publicly based right on how you should do things in handle people and
 treat people and what you should do with your finances all it kind of stuff so if you don't feel
 like you're hearing from God I would go back to prayer I would go to his word and spend quality time in there
 and then I would find people who have been way further down the road now please I'm I'm going to make a
 caveat here I used to be somebody who used to teach a lot of the stuff in the Western Christian church
 that's just not accurate it's just not godly it comes from a whole bunch of paganism that entered
 the belief system 17 hundred years ago if you've not read the book pagan Christianity let me first say
 you may not be ready for it number two let me say you need it don't do audible this is the one book
 I tell people physically read this thing it's gonna rock your world and then talk to people who've
 been through it who understand it who are finding more and more of God's truth who are operating
 more and more God's truth right reach out to us we would be glad to help there's no ifs answer
 about it but if you want to hear from God you've got to make God more important than everything else
 and your entire life if he's not more important than everything then that may be a big reason
 while you're not hearing a lot from him so Chris a lot of people are in partnership you said a
 little awhile ago I think the quote you partnership stuff don't you don't do it it's like and I know
 it's like we've talked about this a lot over the years and for anyone who's new to us it's because they
 often just don't go well and it's like getting married again and it's like it's like having a second
 one they often just don't go well and they follow part and for many many reasons hence the point that
 I think we're about to make when I ask this question is what do you say to the person that's in a
 partnership their sold man we've got to get out of debt the way we're running our business isn't smart
 you're right we're too leveraged but my business partner doesn't agree with this but he that that
 that person is not on the same page is me what do I do in that situation I wish there's an easy answer
 for this the problem is you're dealing with another owner right if I decide to move the business
 in a direction I have to sell you on it but I don't 100% have to have your approval if I own the
 business right now I'm not going to go in a direction that you don't agree with but the point that I'm
 making is is that the end of the day I get to make the final decision so if we were heavily in debt and
 you were like no I don't see a problem with it I think we should keep it well too bad we're getting
 out of debt because I own this thing and I'm the one who owns the debt and I want to done I want
 to go on when it's a partnership you're dealing with somebody else who owns most likely the equivalent
 amount of the business as you do right and that's where you know if you have the deciding fact of the deciding
 vote the deciding percentage great busher but solve it understand you may have that person go
 while I want you to buy me out you know if we're going to go the shop that I want you to buy me out hopefully
 you've got a great buyout plan hopefully you've got a great partnership agreement hopefully you're just
 not an partnership in the first place right so if that happens there's no easy answer
 there is the hey I want to discuss this and and do everything we can to get to this place of
 agreeing on what we should do but at the end of the day if the other partner says no I don't want to
 get out of debt well it's not like you can pay off your half of the debt and the business doesn't have
 debt if you pay down debt you still are paying down the debt that you both oh right now if you could
 work sub deal or you say well I'm going to split it up and pay down my and I'm going to start to take more money home
 I guess maybe it's just not going to work that way I can almost promise you it's not going to work that way
 so the thing you may have to consider is what is it take for you to get bought out what does it look like
 for you to get out of this now keep in mind if you're in debt there's a really good chance you guys don't
 have the money to buy out one of the partners so it's there's no great answer my thing is prayer prayer prayer
 you know do the best you can to help show the other partner how we can leverage cash how getting out of debt is
 going to benefit us you know do the best you possibly can but this is where a lot of partnerships end
 you know this is where a lot of partnerships go south so let's say business leaders down the path
 paying off debt and it's they're like slotted it out like it's hard stuff they're used to
 running and gun in more they're used to doing more it's not this isn't fun to dig themselves out of this
 whole how do they stay the course what's your advice to just stay really resilient so they can actually
 see this thing through one of the the things that I love about the debt snowball is the quick ones
 you know people try to be savvy I want to pay off the highest interest rate I hear you mathematically it
 works but at the highest interest rate doesn't get paid off for three years where's your win
 you know where's the excitement where's the experience of oh my gosh we're doing something incredibly well
 right I'm not saying you can't do it that way what I'm saying is is that for some people they need
 those quick wins now I'm a little bit different um where for me you and I are both very utilitarian
 if we've got to go do something it doesn't matter we're going to do it we're going to pitble it until it's
 done right we're just going to keep going so you know the thing is is I don't want people to try and
 prove that they can do the same thing if you need some quick wins get some stinking quick wins go
 up to the small stuff pay it off you're really good about it well that money over so yes it's going to be
 you didn't get into debt overnight it's going to take you a long time to get out of debt right if it took
 you a long time to get into debt or accumulated or whatever it's going to take you a while to get out of it right
 so I would say go for the quick wins you know get that stuff rolling get it out get it done
 and then roll it under the next one you'll be amazed at how getting rid of a small debt
 energizes you to keep going so that's my suggestion if you are somebody and I man I would
 really want you to really you you have to know that you are highly utilitarian you know that you can just
 keep going you know you and I are two people who absolutely love food we love quality great
 tasting food amazing food but if it's a you know average one's day and we got a crappy salad that
 came through the door from some you know restaurant around and we just needed food in our bodies we're
 just going to eat it we're fine we can move on we can do that kind of thing we're not going to eat
 crap food though you know you stay away from junk food but you get the concept so if you can
 slog it out and it doesn't affect you emotionally then great but I highly suggest go up to the
 ones I don't even if you're highly utilitarian knock off some quick wins and get that great feeling that
 you know get some dopamine pumping through you know feeling good about yourself
 all right last question let's say I'm debt free I get there we get there how do I resist the temptation
 of falling back into debt in the future when I'm looking at some things some opportunities something
 that excites me how do I change my thinking enough to where I don't ever do this again it you would think
 that that would not be an issue you would think that people who got out of debt would be like I'm never
 going back and unfortunately opportunities can push somebody right back into debt even if they've
 been out of it for many many years right and people have asked me that question will Chris are you
 serious like if you if a phenomenal opportunity came up you wouldn't jump at a debt no I've been debt
 free for two decades why would I want to do that the key is I think there's a couple of ways to keep yourself
 from making that decision the first is if it was ever painful for you to be in debt you need to go back
 I mean journal like crazy while you're getting out of debt journal like crazy the things that you
 experienced journal like crazy how it affected your marriage your kids your whatever right your stress levels
 whatever and then go back and read those things if you didn't experience that find people who have
 and let me say to anybody who's listening right now and some of you know I'm speaking directly to you
 who's experienced the negative side of this become a big encouragement for other people not to make the
 same mistake become somebody who helps other people you know don't don't fear judgment help people make the
 decision not to be here so folks if you're if you're thinking oh you know maybe I'll just get back
 in debt for a little bit on this opportunity talk to people who have been there and had the pain
 another thing is is you're missing the point if the opportunity is that great and it requires debt how can it be that
 great it'll come along again or different opportunity will come along something else will happen if it
 requires you to go into debt then I'm telling you it's probably not that great of an opportunity now this
 is an area that people will just flat out disagree oh you don't understand Chris I just got this contract
 from the government well you should probably rip that thing up you know I just got this contract from another
 company and this is gonna be amazing I just have to go into so much debt to service this company you just
 got in bed with a company on your belief that they're gonna run their business correctly that they're
 not gonna run through any problems that they're not gonna experience any crap what if they do and you're
 stuck with all the stuff had clients that experience that too you know what did all of this inventory
 for this company and that company folded and then they were stuck with all the inventory that they had which was
 all debt and couldn't do anything with it so I think there's a lot of things that you can do to remind yourself
 it's not the important thing ultimately what I would say is your worth is not in how
 successful your business is you know continuing to take on opportunities with debt does not make you
 more worthy it doesn't make you better person it doesn't make you smarter in fact I might say for some folks
 it decreases the intellect some it doesn't make you more appreciated by you know intelligent people around you
 although people who don't know anything about running a business probably think you're incredibly smart
 you know it's not your worth it's not your identity love what you're doing run it the best you can
 fill yourself with wisdom from people who teach you how to do it the right way you know what it looks like
 and then money won't be a problem you know one of the things we talk about with strap plan
 we always tell people that strap plan is not about finding money although on average we find I believe
 2.1 million dollars above when we focus on revenue opportunities we find 2.1 million dollars on average
 above what people were expecting for the next 12 months but the way we get there is that we solve all the
 things that are holding them back all of the issues that are keeping them from not only that 2.1
 million but what they're planning on anyways right so we have helped people to just pound the numbers
 out of their brain and say listen don't focus on that focus on the things that are keeping you from
 being there and the money will show up finding money is actually not that difficult it's solving all the
 problems inside of your business that's way more difficult so speaking of solving problems we have
 this big leadership event coming up this spring and do you want to tell the folks all about it
 would love to I would love to tell people about how many leaders are frustrated because they don't have
 the time and tools to lead well I know it's frustrating we all know it's frustrating that's why we do it we do
 right your day gets filled up with fires with people drama with meetings that are simply away
 to time and you never seem to get to what's important and what actually moves the business forward
 reading books and listening to podcasts except for this one aren't helping and not much about your work
 life is changing for the better now again the thing is is that most leaders don't know how to
 implement what they've learned and that's assuming that it was good information to start with and this is why
 we created the next level leadership live event if you feel frustrated or stuck about work these days
 go to christlacrtle.com/events that's christlacrtle.com/events registration opens December 1st with
 $500 off every ticket you buy but that's only for a short time here's the great thing you're going to
 learn the lessons that we practice daily inside of our own business that are only taught at this event the next
 level leadership live event or inside one of our coaching programs on top of that you're going to have
 hours of workshop time this has been one of the most beneficial things that we've discovered at these
 events is as you get to work on the things that we're teaching literally right there on top of that you're
 going to have access to our coaches during that time they will help you to process this so this is only
 a limited time offer so go to christlacrtle.com/events before this offer slips away and get yourself the
 tools you need to lead incredibly well so the more I've been thinking about this event because we're in
 that kind of season you know we've been doing this events since 2016 this specific event and I've been
 thinking a lot about talking it through with the team that about think about that most businesses
 how much money they spend on their people and it's whose job is it to unlock the gifts the talents
 and the potential of that enormous investment that they're making into people it's us it's the leaders
 it's our job if we're not going to learn to lead better who's going to do it who's going to lead these people that
 there's a lot of us have you know team members that come to work and they're devoted they're committed
 but they need great leaders who understand them and their motivators and their personality style and
 that creates the culture and shapes the decision making that makes that team really seeing and that's
 the job of leaders and that's how we do this event it's immense important to you to make you a better
 leader so you can go home and make your team amazingly successful. Well you know it's like we talk about
 with killing the leadership crazy cycle that's we have two lessons on that one is how to kill the leadership
 crazy cycle and then the other one is what to do when you do kill it because so many folks so many
 leaders you know as we said in the front of that so many leaders don't have the tools to lead well so as you're
 saying it's the leaders job to unlock well that's great Joel but I don't really know how to do that
 great exactly that's why we're teaching this that's why we do this is so that you have
 those tools right we want you to kill the leadership crazy cycle we want you to get out of that junk
 and we want you to lead people well but I don't know how to lead and my worth of my identity is being a leader
 don't worry about that get with people who can teach you how to lead well and that's the purpose of this
 event so if you want to unlock the talent of your team and by the way I'm locked your own talent
 there's stuff inside of you that you just don't know how to how to do it yet you haven't figured out
 what does it look like for me to lead really well great that's how we're here so speaking of the
 killing the leadership crazy cycle lesson it's like you that that and then the leading people to success lesson
 and that's inspired me like we should rename the leading people to success lesson it's dead now do this
 but that's what we should rename it that's my bit for today but so you killed the leadership crazy
 cycle now what now do these things that's so great all right thank you so much for all of the wisdom
 for two hours worth of a two-part series on running a debt-free business and the mental health and
 emotional health and the God aspects to it I feel like it's been a great great two-part discussion
 so thank you for all the wisdom hopefully guys you all are gaining a lot from this there's no doubt
 this is probably challenged you unless you've been like whatever Chris it's like this is all stupid
 like if you really dug in and listen this is probably challenged you in some way spiritually practically
 leadership wise and you know that's a good thing we we were having discussions with our own team just this
 morning about things that are like just be willing to be challenged challenge you're thinking challenge
 what you think you know stay open to learning and you'll continue to learning grow and rather than throw
 up the defenses and just been like nope I've got it but my fingers in the years and so hopefully this
 is this has benefited you guys a lot so Chris thank you oh my gosh absolutely absolutely thank you for
