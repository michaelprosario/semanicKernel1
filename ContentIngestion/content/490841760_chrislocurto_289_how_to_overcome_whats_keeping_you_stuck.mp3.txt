 The greatest change in media think is being happy and accountable and calm and the level
 of frustration is just almost obsolete when you can't know how frustrated you are until
 you go through.
 You just don't even know it.
 And now I can just be as almost like being free.
 Welcome to the Crystal Cardo Show where we discuss leadership and life and discover that
 business is what you do, not who you are.
 Folks, welcome to the show today.
 Today we are talking about what we refer to as junk and life.
 So if you're ready to talk about junk, we have junk.
 We all have junk in our lives and today we get to talk about it.
 Now what am I talking about?
 What does that look like for a good number of people?
 It's worry.
 It's worry about work.
 It's worry about families.
 It's worry about kids, money, deadlines.
 Whatever that is, it's all of this worry that we tend to have the bad things in life.
 It's those things that just constantly causes to feel like something bad is going to happen.
 In security, fighting or disunity and marriages, friendships which are just terrible.
 It's tough.
 That's junk feeling, not good enough.
 Judgment, needing to be right.
 Some of us not being able to be wrong.
 We get a lot of folks that don't realize that they can't be wrong.
 It really affects them being selfish.
 Perfectionism, yes.
 Perfectionism is junk fearing failure or fearing too much in general, striving or trying to get
 others to approve of us.
 Good night.
 So many people spend so much time trying to get others to approve of them.
 needing to be in control, feeling responsible for others.
 Yes, this is a, this is a, this is a log list.
 It's just a piece of what we experience or what we go through or what we discover.
 Feeling guilty, getting offended easily, anxiety.
 How many are all just getting anxious just hearing this list?
 I know it's, it's a lot.
 That's nothing.
 We discover a heck of a lot of stuff that people are dealing with that we would call junk
 in the life.
 You know, that's just a list that I, that I read, but maybe there's other stuff that you're
 experiencing.
 So this may be something that's hitting home, but you may have other things in that I haven't
 mentioned that are probably hitting home as well.
 The problem is is that it holds us back until we gain perspective on it.
 That's just the beginning faces.
 There's to really gain some great understanding on what it is and what do we do with it.
 So today we're not staying focused on the junk, but instead we're talking about how to overcome
 it, not putting a bandaid on it or finding distractions from it, but taking steps to get past
 it.
 We don't want you to learn how to cope with it.
 We want you to get past that kind of stuff, which is why we have a special guest on today.
 Someone who can speak to getting unstuck and starting the process of overcoming this kind of junk.
 So our guest is a small business owner, a fantastic leader, husband and father.
 Our guest today is Ryan, Aubrey, and Ryan.
 Welcome to the show.
 Thank you, Chris.
 Glad to be here.
 So good to have you on.
 Were you getting anxious through that whole list?
 A little bit.
 Yes.
 Bringing up a lot of bad stones.
 No.
 Let us suffer there that just hits home, right?
 Right.
 Before we get into all this stuff, I've got to say you have one of the coolest names.
 It was great discover in this because your last name, Aubrey, and Russian means werewolf.
 That's right.
 Look at that.
 You brought that to our attention.
 Yeah, we discovered that.
 I don't remember who it was.
 I think it was Savannah or somebody discovered that.
 Lakuro and Sicilian means the short.
 It's not as cool as where we are.
 It's not as cool as what we are.
 But I'm six foot three.
 So come on.
 So we have a lot of great things to talk about today.
 You and I first met.
 Cash.
 Was it?
 I don't even know.
 That was the one.
 That was the one.
 It was a mastermind retreat in November of 16.
 There you go.
 So you've been through so much stuff.
 You're in the next level of mastermind group.
 You've been through next level of life.
 You guys literally just finished strapline last week.
 Is everybody still alive?
 We are.
 We are hanging in there for sure.
 So a very tough tough week, but a very powerful week.
 Love to have in you guys in here.
 So you and your brother Brad, our co-owners of this business.
 And you also happen to be the reigning Cornhole champions here at the mastermind retreats.
 This is true.
 We do not have the best record of any of that.
 That's true.
 I think we lost one game.
 I think it was one game.
 I think after like 20 games and you're like, hey, just go ahead and want it.
 But obviously that is a bit of one of the things we got these funky little trophies that we
 do at the next level of mastermind retreats.
 And these guys have won it over and over again.
 It's just been.
 You hear guys trying to set up teams, right?
 Some of the guys are trying to set up teams.
 Some of the guys are trying to set up those ring your teams.
 Nobody's done it yet.
 Before we get another stuff, tell us a little bit about you what life is like, what do
 you do for work, your family, how do you do it all that kind of fun stuff?
 My brother and I own a commercial flooring business here in North Carolina.
 I have been married for almost 10 years.
 I have two boys, seven and four.
 And they are cutie-pice.
 Good.
 Thank you very much.
 I take out to their mother.
 That's good.
 And we've been in business for 15 years.
 This is a family business.
 My dad was in business.
 Started in the 70s and he's that before him had a furniture business.
 And we've kind of just grown it up, moved over to the commercial side over the last 15
 years.
 And we've both been through next level of life.
 Yeah.
 There's definitely no issues when it comes to family business, right?
