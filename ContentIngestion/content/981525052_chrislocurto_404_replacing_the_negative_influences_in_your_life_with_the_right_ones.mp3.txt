 The negative that you get rid of, but you don't replace may come back to haunt you.
 That is coming up next.
 Welcome to the Chris LaCardo Show, where we discuss leadership and life, and discover that business is what you do, not who you are.
 Hey folks, welcome to the show.
 Hope you're having a fabulous day.
 We are, as we look out on a nice cool brisk 28 degrees here.
 I don't know what you're experiencing where you are, but it's been rainy.
 A little bit of snow, and I think we got some snow coming, so for the, I think I'm the only guy in Tennessee who is excited about that.
 Coming from snow country, I enjoy it.
 I think everybody else is hates it, but there's probably three of us here.
 Today we're talking about replacing negative influences.
 And I got to tell you, this is one of the most important things for you to focus on when you are trying to get a healthier version of yourself.
 A lot of times we can do all kinds of things and not recognize the need to replace the unhealthy things, the unhealthy influences.
 So sometimes if you're looking at doing a lot of know a diet or something like that, you realize that sugar is not good.
 So you take out the sugar, but sometimes you don't realize that having three other people in your house that are still eating sugar actually is a negative influence.
 So you may not be eating sugar at the moment, but you're being influenced as you're watching other people do it.
 And so that tends to wear on you. So that's just a tiny example of something we're going to be talking about today.
 If we look at Matthew 1243 through 45, when an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through airing places seeking rest and does not find it.
 Then it says, "I will return to the house I left, one of the arrives, it finds the house I'm occupied, swap clean and put an order."
 Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself and they go in and live there.
 And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.
 What's the point that is being made here? Well, the Lord is pointing out that when we remove negative things or impure things,
 and we don't replace it with good stuff, then believe it or not, it makes it very easy for those impure or negative things to flood back in.
 It makes it a lot easier if we don't have good stuff inside of us.
 Replace it with good influences. So influences once removed, leave a vacuum.
 That's an important thing to understand. If you have a toxic friend in your life and you remove that toxic person, but you do not replace your social life with healthy people, then guess what?
 It leaves that vacuum that void that plays for toxic people to creep right back into.
 If not replaced, then they tend to come back and it tends to be worse.
 You use ever struggled with any type of addiction, whether it be drugs, alcohol, submissiveness, control, anger, any of that kind of stuff that you've ever dealt with.
 Then you know that if you're able to shake it for a while, but you don't do something about it, then when it comes back it actually gets worse.
 We have to be intentional about replacing the negativity. So Chris, I don't do drugs. Great. Fantastic. That's a wonderful thing.
 But what is your social feed? Look like?
 What is your social, your Facebook, your Instagram, your YouTube, whatever all that kind of stuff? How much news do you want?
 How many unhealthy people do you allow in your life? These are the things that we are going to be talking about today.
 We're going to talk more about that when we come back right after this.
