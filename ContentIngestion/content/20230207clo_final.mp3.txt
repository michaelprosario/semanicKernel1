 Today we're going to look at the interesting and sometimes surprising takeaways of those
 who've gone through our processes and participated in our coaching and training events.
 That is coming up next.
 Welcome to the Crystal Acredo Show, where we discuss leadership and life and discover that
 business is what you do, not who you are.
 Welcome to the show folks.
 I hope you're having a fabulous day or a fabulous year so far.
 Wherever you are, we are having a pretty fantastic one ourselves and I got to tell you
 I'm excited today because for the first time of this year, I'm joined by two amazing men.
 So Erin Weston, Joel Fortner, welcome to the show for the first time in 2023.
 Welcome guys.

 Erin, you're in the virtual studio.

 Well, this month we have the awesome privilege.
 And I say privilege because I do believe it is a privilege.
 It's a blessing of God that we are celebrating 10 years of making a difference in
 leaders lives and helping them to take their businesses to the next level.
 And while this is stuff that I've been doing way before this and you know, you guys have
 been doing before this, it's 10 years of this swimming group.
 And we're really excited about that.
 It's like I say, it's just an honor.
 And in this episode, we're going to walk through the specialized areas of
 teaching and coaching and training that we do for businesses.
 But before we get to that, let me pause to talk about this amazing event that's coming up.
 And just a few months that's geared towards helping your team to grow to improve to excel at their job.
 The fact is that the more effective you become as a leader.
 And we'll talk about this stuff throughout this episode today.
 The more effective your team becomes, which means the more your business will grow with less stress on you.
 Yes, folks, this is why we do what we do.
 Trust me, we can teach you how to have less stress on you.
 Now, it's if you're ready to take a hugely forward in your leadership capability, then you absolutely need to check out our next level of leadership live event coming up this April.

 Now, when we come back, how our various services have evolved in our company and some of the core impacts that they've had on businesses, leaders and owners.
 Hey, leaders. This is Joel Fortner, VP, Leadership Development, Acrissal Cardo's company. I have some questions for you.
 Do you as a leader feel like you are caught up in a crazy cycle of stress and tasks that never ends week to week?
 Do you ever have to deal with tough conversations with team members, and you sit at home the next day, the night before, worried about how's it going to go?
 What am I going to say? What are they going to say? Can I think fast enough on my feed? Is it going to be a total failure?
 Are you experiencing culture problems or that stuff that just breaks down trust and unity on your team?
 Well, if you can relate to any of this, this is a pretty typical leadership story in situation.
 Here's the thing though. It doesn't have to be that way, and we can help you solve these things.
 We can help you become the leader that solves these problems and leads their team to greater success.
 I want to introduce you to the key leaders program.
 This is an ongoing leadership development program that gives you the lesson track, coaching and accountability you need to become the leader you can become to actually implement what you're actually learning in this program.
 Things fall apart without great leadership and intentionality.
 If you want to solve the problems that are holding you back from being a great leader, we can help you with this program, get in touch with Joel at crissacardo.com.
 Alright, we are back joined again by Joel Forner, Erin West. Guys, I'd like you to help me to describe what it is that we do.
 I mean, it's super easy. There's nothing to it.
 So for someone who's hearing it for the first time, let's unpack some of the acronyms we use, the things that we do.
 How do we explain this to folks if this is the first time they're hearing us?
 Yeah, I'll go. So I mean, first run off the bat, I mean, included in our mission statement is that we guide people to greater perspective.
 We're teachers. I mean, we are our hardest to teach people to develop people, to help people get unstuck in life, to get unstuck in business, become a more effective leader at home and at work.
 And so we have all these various programs that we have of next level mastermind that Erin runs and key leader program that Erin runs and all these awesome virtual training events and in person training events that that we do.
 And also next level life that's near and dear to our heart are one on one where you come and spend a couple days with either you or me Chris and we dive super deep, solving what's holding you back and getting you a plan to improve your life.
 It's a healing and restoration event for so many people. So those are that's the stuff that's what we do. That's how we guide people to greater perspective.
 And I love it. You know, I want to back up a little bit more from there and just talk about the beginning of this.
 We're all entrepreneurs. We've all on businesses. We've been helping people for a very long time.
 You know, this is something that I've been doing for decades helping businesses helping individuals, but this business, the point main group, it started on my back patio.
 It started literally as God was guiding me to a new direction of helping people. I thought this was going to be just one aspect. That was just going to be coaching.
 You know, I literally thought when I started this thing, I thought, well, it's going to be business coaching. I feel like that's what God's got to me to because he kept showing me specific things.
 And then these other aspects popped up. I've been helping people with their individual lives for many, many years. I was like, well, let's just add this piece in somebody might like it who knows.
 But yeah, I started on the back patio with me, Brian Alex, who joined me back in those first few months before he left for Sicily on a mission field.
 It was just the two of us, we always joke. It was the two of us are two laptops, a couple of cell phones and a bottle of wine.
 It was just like we sit out there and just dream about what was going to happen. What God was doing.
 And interestingly enough, if you just listed off stuff that did not even exist in my mind back then stuff that it was like, okay, we're going to do coaching.
 You know, I'll help some people on the personal side.
 We'll probably do this offer this big, strat plan, a week long event, but you know, I mean that's big, that's huge.
 We did not have a few leaders program in there. We did not have the virtual training, well, we didn't have virtual training period.
 Not a lot of people had virtual trainings. We didn't have the virtual trainings. We didn't have the go into the people's businesses and doing whole team trainings. There's so much that we didn't have.
 And it was just this blessing of being able to help people leave their team better, run their business better.
 And then things just exploded. Obviously next level of life exploded.
 We just celebrated not too long ago. A couple weeks ago are 500. One on one next level of life of the huge just with the main.
 Pretty good for something that we should be on the side.
 This is a little thing. We just help some people.
 You know, what do a little, you know, if they needed, they wanted and then 500 events later.
 It's just so powerful. And this year our goal and guys, if we're helping me to know if we're going to hit this because this is something we're planning on.
 And that is to offer a live event. So we can bring groups of people in the one on one event is always going to be just the most impactful and powerful today event.
 But we want to be able to reach people if they can't make it to that in a group setting.
 So just so looking forward to that and we're working toward it.
 So just a special announcement that we're actually doing this event later this year.
 You know, maybe this is our first kind of casual thrown it out there.
 I think that was it. We're working on it. Our goal is to have this for the fall.
 Yeah, it's stuff we've already got together. We're just building the whole event building it and structuring it for a group setting where everybody coming in can get.
 Obviously, we want to work one on one with them.
 But we will be able to get them crazy transformative information and impact.
 It's going to be such a great introduction. If you've never done something like this or you're really into, you know, improving yourself and growing yourself and solving what holds you back.
 This is going to be a great step in that direction.
 I'm really excited guys to see how many people who've come through next summer life actually want to come to this event as well.
 Because I bet there's a whole bunch of people that are going to want to do that kind of as a refresh on their event that they may have had.
 You know, 10 years ago or five years ago or two years ago, this this live event is going to be very exciting.
 Yeah, and we'll talk more about that. I'm sure in a couple of weeks.
 This this 10 years of business side is funny. We're kicking off and talking so much more about the last side.
 We're going to do the same thing on that life side. And I can I so look forward to that as well being able to talk through the transformation of things that people have experienced.
 But here we are on the business side.
 And I've got to say I'm just so incredibly proud of you guys and what how I hear all the time, you know, for years.
 I just keep hearing people tell me it just never stops you know, Joel and Aaron, these guys are just amazing. You guys have done phenomenal job obviously helping people.
 And we have all three been coaching businesses, business leaders, owners for a very long time. And so it's just so powerful.
 But I wanted to kind of dig into and I want you guys to jump in and talk through some of the the struggles that people are experiencing the successes that people are experiencing.
 What is it as people go through our stuff because our our stuff is not easy.
 We don't do the 30,000 foot view. We dig in deep. So kind of talk to that Aaron kind of speak to you know you've been on both sides of great phenomenal 30,000 foot view information and also great phenomenal dig super deep information kind of talk about what that's like what's what yeah, what do you love.
 I mean the big thing is is there's tons of information out there that'll get you started with your business. There's tons of great resources out there that'll give you that 30,000 foot view.
 But man one of the things that I love about what we do is being able to dig into your individual situation and then help you move forward in what's going on specifically with you at your time at your moment with your business with your team.
 Whether it's struggles in how do I lead my team through this difficult situation whether struggles in hey I'm struggling to to make revenue and get great revenue and make profit off of this.
 How do I work through this how do I identify those things and this is the kind of stuff that gets into really working hard there's no and we talk about this all the time there's no magic pills.
 And what we do it's hard work and it's digging into those deep things that absolutely love what we do that allows us to do that whether it's through our mastermind or we're doing one on one coaching and group coaching with
 Mastermind clients or whether it's leading the secondary level leaders like in our key leader program we talked about earlier just helping the entire leadership team work through those challenges at a deep level.
 And digging into their specific problems are the things that absolutely love about what we get to do on a day in and day out basis.
 Yeah, it's it's so interesting because again, you know, I used to teach you know you were with me Aaron back in those days I would teach 18 lessons in three days powerful phenomenal great stuff.
 Usually I was in a coma after that, but just great stuff, but man I could step off that stage and somebody could say can I just ask you one question can I just get 15 minutes and I could help somebody change their business in that time frame and I just kept hearing you know what I felt like was God saying you're going to be doing this.
 And so again loved every bit of it, but I felt God saying I want you to go deeper and so like our next level leadership live event.
 And I was going to do that.
 And I was going to do that.
 What are some of the struggles that leaders face, what are there some of the success of all those things kind of talk through those those specific pieces.
 Yeah, I think one of the big ones that we see upfront in a coaching relationship is how much is on the leaders plate how much task, how much of the operations, how much of the sales, how much of the marketing.
 Is on the owner or it's on the CEO or the president or the just leadership team everything's on them and they're they're way too involved.
 So therefore they're stressed overwhelmed and completely touch saturated and they can't lead their teams well and many of them recognize that and they know that you know what this needs to change so like our verbiage is the leadership crazy cycle.
 Well, one of the first things we focus on is helping leaders kill the leadership crazy cycle so they can then get freed up to go lead to go work on their teams and go deep in all of the leadership stuff that we teach so we teach.
 Detail and depth and open your eyes up to all this wonderful stuff you can do is a leader but if you're stuck and you literally don't have the time to accomplish it the depth doesn't mean anything.
 So we have to walk people down this journey or this path to get to a place of okay what's next well when we solve those pieces this is what's next go install that do it really well.
 And we say what's next and that's why we work with people for years you know it's amazing the long term relationships it's been always been amazing to me and we we've joked about this over the years of how many leaders think they're the only ones going through this so you know the the overwhelmed.
 I don't have time for my family you know I don't even know what I got done today I've been running 90 to nothing.
 I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been doing this for a while. I've been
 I think that's one of the things that I love when they get it I love when they realize I got to do something because then they step in and go I'm not the only one.
 I think that's something that's really just you know been powerful for me to say yeah I think that's it's speaking to that mr. moment I think that that I'm the only one who's failing like this.
 Cold people back from accepting change because to come in to do work with us in the kind of work that we do you have to come in ready to change and ready to tackle a whole lot.
 I think that's what you feel like you're the only one that's out there floundering and flopping around it's a person's your own a time to turn pride it's your own fear.
 I think that's what you're doing is you're doing it's your own embarrassment that holds you back from being like you know what actually need help to actually run and do this better because then you get more into a mindset of it's going to be a lot of work.
 We've got to change a lot of stuff we have to change all kinds of processes that's why it's a long term thing it's like we don't typically coach people for three months and six months and they're done it becomes a let us come and help you work for years.
 I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's
 I think that's what you're doing is out where are you in your life as it meets your business and then we help people go from fifty eight this is our own internal servant we go for the eight up to eighty and with scores all the way up to to the 90s because people are looking at my life is in such a better place.
 That's the goal for us that's the thing we see that's like praise God Hallelujah. Well Aaron how many. How can you because you work with both the next level mastermind clients you work with the key leaders program the key leaders.
 How many folks think.
 You know, oh gosh, I'm embarrassed that I'm out of fifty eight. I suck and I'm the only one. I mean you you get to see it. Oh yeah.
 Oh yeah, there's a lot of conversations that I have with our clients where they're very much of this mindset of man I'm a struggling leader I suck as a leader and I'm a horrible leader and they see these results and they they tell them themselves he sings.
 But after we get into conversations we realize why are they where they are what's the struggle that they're having and how do we help them move beyond that.
 Interestingly enough back in January actually onboarded five new people into our mastermind program and all five of them we talked about this killing the leadership crazy cycle on our onboarding call.
 Because of how important that piece is and all of them recognize their struggle right there at the beginning so understanding that piece at the very beginning just like Joel was talking about.
