 business is what you do, not who you are.

 Welcome to the Crystal Cardo Show.
 Today we are going to do something a little different with everything that is going on in the
 world.
 We want to encourage you and give you some hope as well.
 So whether you are a business owner or a state home parent who has suddenly become your
 kids teacher, we want to encourage you during this time.
 So today we're going to share with you part of the conversation that Joel and I had on our
 Facebook live recently.
 So if you want to watch the entire discussion, which is almost about two hours, let's
 good stuff there, please visit our page on Facebook.
 We hope you find some good news in the conversation today and we thank you for joining us.
 So Chris, we've hit on this a little bit more, but it's incredibly important and
 loans are being peddled like crazy right now.
 Loans of all shapes and sizes.
 I mean, there are all sorts of loans and people are coming after you to get
 alone, whether it's personally, especially businesses that they know are scared
 to death, they entrepreneurs who don't want to give up on their dream owners who feel
 super guilty about laying people off and they will reach for everything possible to keep
 themselves afloat and debt and loans are so attractive right now.
 What is your advice there?
 Okay, listen, as I share this stuff, this is my opinion, this is where I'm coming from.
 I have been doing this for decades.
 I praise God how a little you am sitting in a place because I prepared for this time
 and did things the way that we teach.
 Currently, we are not laying anybody off.
 And I have options because I've been doing it this way for a long time.
 So here's what I do not want you to hear.
 I'm speaking to you where you are today, not where you've been.
 So I don't want you to receive shame.
 This isn't a shaming discussion.
 I'm not telling you you're horrible person.
 I am probably going to tell you you've been listening to the wrong people because, you know,
 for as long I can't tell you how many businesses over the last few decades that I've talked to them
 not going ballistic.
 They're like, "Sir, I can double my business if I go take this loan."
 In good times.
 In good times.
 "Sir, I go take this loan."
 That's not the way to go double your business.
 That's going to hurt you.
 That's going to affect you.
 I cannot even number of businesses that I've said slow down.
 You know, do it this way over here and they're like, "Ah, Chris does not even talk about."
 And they've come back to me saying, "Okay, how do I fix this?"
 Because I did it my way and I screwed up.
 It's not first off.
 Growing your bit, so I'm speaking to preparing for times like this.
 Okay?
 Growing your business by going heavily in debt.
 What happens in times like this?
 Right now, you're struggling.
 You don't have the finances.
 You're having to balance.
 Oh, well, I can defer amount.
 Okay.
 But still, you've cut out your legs from underneath you because you don't have opportunities.
 You know, debt robes you of your options.
 Right?
 So those that have done a really good job of not being in debt and stockpiling money and growing at a slower rate
 or doing great during this time.
 And even if their business part is falling off, they're not closing their doors.
 They're still, they have options.
 So you have to take a look at this time right now and go, "Had I not done debt?
 Where would I be right now?"
 Where would my personal finances be?
 Where would my business finances be?
 And if you're seeing from me, if this is hitting you the wrong way and you're just off of me right now, ask yourself the question why.
 Why are you mad at me?
 Right?
 I'm pointing out something from somebody who's a practitioner who is done this for a long time and is one at it has been successful at it.
 And it's what I teach our clients and they do it.
 Okay?
 So if you're upset with this conversation right now, let's ask yourself the question why.
 Why are you upset at this?
 Right?
 So I'm not saying you should be ashamed.
 I'm not trying to make it feel horrible about yourself.
 I'm trying to show you that if you make better decisions from this moment going forward, you'll be in a better place.
 Right?
 It's not about sitting here and going, "Well, let me cry over spilled milk, but freaking recognize that the milk has been spilled."
 Right?
 Recognize we've not made the best choices.
 Who could possibly, and this is what people are going to say, "Well, how could I have known that there was going to be a coronavirus, Chris?"
 Well, the Bible says, "Be prepared for any disaster."
 Second, chronicle 713-14, where God says, "I will send a plague upon your land, and if you will repent and seek me and pray to me and follow me, do the things that I'm saying, overloaded."
 Okay.
 So we have a God who shown us, "Hey, stuff's going to happen. Where are you going to be when it does?"
 All right?
 So with that, what about all these loans and everything?
 We had a great discussion on Wednesday about it.
 The SBA disaster loans, and again, I want you to understand, I am not researching and living crap out of this and watching the news like crazy.
 I'm just got small amounts of information on what's being offered.
 So here's what I thought the loans were going to come out and be interest-free, which I still wouldn't do the loan anyways, but actually are not interest-free.
 Actually, I'm actually calm with that, I think it's like a 3.75% interest rate.
 Check it out, I may be wrong on that.
 Here's what you have to recognize about going into debt right now.
 That needs to be your absolute last option.
 I want you to check all the things that I've already mentioned already.
 But kid people's 401k contributions out, right? That is not an important thing. That's not an essential thing right now.
 Take a hard look at where you're spending money. Well, we got office cleaners that come in and clean our office at 5154,000 a month.
 Hey, pick up the broom and pick up the toilet scrubber, right?
 Let's put some people to work. All they're not going to work for that.
 Well, then okay, then you don't need to be paying them if they can't actually jump it and take care of things in a time like this.
 Take a look at the expenses where you're spending money.
 Make sure you hold on to the smart things.
 A lot of times, it's like we're talking about, with madness.
 Some of his clients, they were worried about their clients.
 We're going to start yanking money from their marketing spend and one of his clients is like, are you kidding?
 This is the time that the C&D level law firms are all going to pull out.
 I want to stay on top because it's going to separate us from everybody else.
 You have to take a hard look at where you're spending your money and also recognize what are the smart spends that you can put your money into things that keep pushing you,
 your leadership, your business along your team along.
 If you're spending money in areas that just aren't that important, if you're dropping hundreds of dollars on your coffee and
 you know, hey guys, we would never do that.
 Yeah, we do.
 We don't want to be guys.
 We do spend a lot of money on coffee around this place, right?
 But we have to make smart decisions.
 We have to go through all those expenses and say, okay, what are we going to put on hold?
 What are we going to stop?
 But what are we not going to stop?
 Stop and we're spending money on growing our people.
 We still have coaches and stuff that we spend money on for our people to keep them growing,
 especially in its own, like this, to learn a thing that they need to be doing to handle situations like this, right?
 So take a look at those expenses, take a hard look at if it gets absolutely desperate.
 Do you pay rent, right?
 So think about it.
 You need to be somebody might rather still take a pay cut for a couple of weeks than take an employment.
 It's probably still, you know, for some of a lot of your folks, it's still maybe a better place for them to be than unemployment, right?
 The amount of money that they're going to bring home on unemployment is probably considerably less.
 So look through all of these pieces first.
 Make decisions, smart decisions based on all of that, right?
 You might take a look at some of your vendors.
 If you are leasing a business base, I mean, actually, I don't know.
 Maybe you have some conversations there where some of your, your vendor or some of the places that you have expenses and see if there is a just fence that they can do, right?
 With that being said,
 you have to then remember this when it comes to any of the loans that you're taking.
 Any of the loans that you're taking, you're going to have to pay them back.
 Okay, so what we originally thought was, is that there were going to be interest free and then you would still have to pay the money back.
 However, they're coming with interest as far as I can tell, no.
 I may be wrong, but the ones that I've seen saw the small business disaster loans the other day that were in 3.75.
 So I don't know if they've changed anything since, but point that I'm making is, we're still going to have to pay that back.
 Well, Chris, I got to pay my people.
 Okay, are they working and still creating revenue inside of the business?
 Nope, they're not working at all.
 Then here's what I'm going to ask, do I take a loan out to pay people who aren't working?
 I don't think that's a smart idea.
 I would not do that.
 I love my people.
 I will take care of my people as long as I can.
 I, you know, I'll do anything.
 However, if I am losing everything inside of the business, money is not coming in.
 I'm not going to feel guilty that I take out a loan for a business that's plummeting to pay people who aren't working.
 Right?
 It doesn't make sense.
 Your guilt does not make sense.
 And believe me, nobody's going to, if somebody looks at you and is like, I can't believe you're not paying me for not working.
 They probably shouldn't be working at your business in the first place, right?
 Are you not lend them well?
 Exactly.
 So it comes to getting the loans.
 I'm going to buy a pass as long as I, I won't be getting along.
 I mean, I, I will have to make other decisions if it never gets to that place.
 I personally, I'm doing that.
 Some of you are in a place right now where because of when you're leveraged, it might be your option to keep your doors open.
 So I'm going to say if that's where you are, then make smart decisions.
 Gain is much perspective as you possibly can.
 Don't go taking out a lot of money.
 Don't go blow this thing out of water.
 Make as many adjustments as you possibly can.
 But ask yourself the question, what if you do take out that loan and you're still in a closing your doors?
 Would that have been a better decision than shutting it down sooner?
 Right?
 So I know this is a difficult conversation.
 I know it's a painful conversation.
 But it's a good thing to be through, get insanely creative on things you can do before you ever do that.
 Get really creative, tax your, they can do it.
 Ask them for input, right?
 You might have people on your team that are going, hey, I think we can do make this thing over here and sell this right now.
 I think I'd be willing to do that, you know, I don't know what it is.
 But I would know if you lost a ditch effort.
 Yeah, that was super fantastic advice, especially looking at the coincide of thinking through this decision and looking at the consequences you may be choosing as a result of this.
 You've talked a lot about preparation and I think as we both know and we've lived a little bit is that you don't prepare for a crisis in the midst of the crisis.
