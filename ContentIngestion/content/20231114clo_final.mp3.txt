 On today's episode, we have an exciting topic to discuss that you as leaders of business
 owners cannot miss the mental and emotional benefits of running a debt-free business.
 That is coming up next.
 Welcome to the Crystal Acredo Show, where we discuss leadership and life and discover
 that business is what you do not who you are.
 Welcome to the show, folks.
 I hope you're having a fabulous day wherever you are.
 Today, joining me on the show is the great, the fabulous, the incredibly attractive
 joe fortman.
 Welcome to the show, joe.
 Good.
 Good to be here.
 I'm not always described as attractive.
 But I'll take it.
 Incredibly.
 Extremely, whatever I say.
 There you go.
 So good to have you on.
 Hey, Joel is joining me today because this is a tough topic.
 This is a topic that is difficult for people to hear.
 I can tell you as somebody who has been leading business owners and leaders for decades.
 This is a very painful topic for me because of how much this discussion, this topic is hurt people,
 has affected people.
 I'm not just talking about the business owners and I'm not just talking about the teams, but
 families as well.
 So as we get into this, I do want to say, please just stick with this.
 If this is something that you're like, "Oh, I don't need to hear this.
 I know how to handle money.
 I know how to.
 I'm better than that.
 I got this stuff figured out.
 If you do me favor just stick with us.
 Just hear what we have to say.
 And hopefully maybe there might be some things that you'll pick up to.
 At least, I'd just a little bit of the security you have in debt.
 This is coming from a heart of a teacher who has counseled many people through this process.
 So I just wanted to throw that out there.
 If many of you are already like, I don't want to listen to this.
 I'm not getting anything from it.
 I promise you you will.
 So with that being said, I'm going to turn this on over to Joel to get us kicked off.
 Yeah, so I mean, this is a tough topic.
 It's like it's funny.
 It's like you said a debt-free business and a debt-free business for a moment.
 It's like, you know, there's something actually to that funny enough that depending on what
 you do with money and debt, it can be that destructive.
 So that's why we want to talk about it.
 And we've talked about it again on the show.
 But we wanted to do this show a little different where I interview you and draw out a lot of
 your perspective.
 I'll share a little bit.
 Probably as well.
 I used to be someone that had no problem with debt.
 And I was the person that I always thought, it's like, I'll always have a car payment.
 Just talking about personal debt.
 It's been, it's so refreshing when I started to learn from you and back in Dave Ramsey days.
 And I met Mary Beth and she worked with you at Dave's.
 All this stuff about money and debt, and really started being like, wow, this is there's
 really something to this.
 And I remembered my personal walk that I was standing in Mary Beth's kitchen one day when we were
 dating.
 And I was a single guy living in small town Tennessee making really good money for a single person.
 And I had no money.
 Because I was spending everything.
 And it was just going here there and everywhere.
 And I finally got mad enough about it.
 And that was the beginning of changing for me.
 Little that I know at the time that Mary Beth needed to see that change in me.
 Of course, she would ever entertain a longer term relationship or definitely marrying me.
 Because she'd paid off.
 I mean, tens of thousands of dollars of debt.
 I mean, you watched her do that.
 And probably canceled her a lot along the way.
 But I'd never be married to the person that I am today if I had not made those decisions.
 Because there's no way she was going to get wrapped up with spending Joel.
 So let's get into this first.
 Well, as you do, it's so funny, as you say that.
 And I've known this story forever.
 I was there during this story, but for the first time, it's so interesting the way you say it.
 I'm somebody who worked PR for the military, for the Air Force.

 you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
 you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
 you're, you're down the road, you're making your decision, you're, you're going to continue on. Ask any of our clients who have done that in the past and have regretted it like crazy and see what their responses.
 And you know, I've done it. I've made terrible decisions in the past that I've regretted. My thing is is that I'm just a very, you know, I, my focus is calculated risk. I very much calculate risk. Not a motion.
 I'm not calculating emotion. I'm calculating what could the, how could this fail and what would it look like if it did. So for me, I failed an incredible amount of times. That's why we have this business.
 God's just revealed to us how to fix them. And what to do differently and how to be smarter. So this isn't coming from a guy who hasn't made mistakes. I've made tons of mistakes.
 I'm, this is wisdom from mistakes. This is knowledge from mistakes. Don't go out there and convince yourself you're going to be the first person who savvy and really handle this well.
 I saw something the other day that said all of the socialist college students, we should make it mandatory that they go that we send them off to their country of choice.
 The socialist country of choice and let them survive there and see what they think do they still agree that socialism is fantastic. It's amazing.
 You know, as a college student, you're, you're smarter than everybody else on the planet, right? You just know so much more than everybody else.
 So if this socialist thing really truly works, although it's never worked not even once on the planet and the main argument against that as well, it's because nobody's done it correctly.
 Great, go live in one of these socialist countries and change them. Do it the right way. See what happens. The concept of I feel this is right. I can't do this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore.
 None of that matters.
 If you're not going to make smart decisions, I have worked in businesses that I hated, hated.
 And I didn't leave until I could cover my butt until I could take care of myself and put food on my table.
 You know, and I've had, I've had some businesses that I ran in my early days, logistics was one of the ones I am so good at logistics and I hate working, you know, in some of those environments.
 It's just toxic.
 But instead of leaving, I waited on God. I prayed, prayed, and prayed, and prayed, and prayed.
 And God opened the door, I stepped out and it was smooth. The transition was smooth. It was great. It worked really well.
 So there's a lot of pushback on this concept of I don't want to, or I've got this great opportunity that would be less stressful.
 Folks, if you've never opened an operated business, which I've opened an operated many businesses, many, then you don't know what you're talking about.
 If you don't have the experience, you know, I love what Zigg used to say.
 And entrepreneurs, the only person, so business owner, is the only person who can go from sheer exhilaration to sheer terror and back in the same 24 hours.
 That's what business ownership is like.
 So this concept of I'm going to leave my negative toxic environment that I work in, and I'm going to go work in an a phenomenal, incredible opportunity that is my new business with debt.
 I'm sorry that it doesn't happen that way. And if it does, if there's the unicorn out there, great, fantastic. But that's one in how many millions of businesses, right?
 Keep in mind, the number of businesses that close because people don't know what the crap they're doing.
 So I'm sorry, am I being too passionate about this?
 Is there, can you feel, can you feel the pain of all of the folks that I've helped that we have helped?
 Our business has helped over the years that have experienced the negative side.
 So speaking to the person who's just convinced that they've got this, man, don't take my words, go speak to people.
 But there's so much more that we could speak about on this.
 Yeah, so Chris, thank you. So we are, we're out of time for today. We're going to, guys, we're going to do a second part on this discussion.
 So make sure that you listen in on part two of the mental and emotional benefits of running a debt-free business.
 So yeah.
 Well folks, again, I hope this information is helpful. We are not done. We've got a lot more to talk about.
 One of the things we want to talk about, especially because of what time of year it is, we want to talk about the next level leadership live event.
 As you've heard me say, many leaders are frustrated because they don't have time and tools to lead well.
 Your days get filled up with fires with people drama, with meetings that are simply a waste of time, and you never seem to get to what's important.
 And what actually moves the business forward, reading books and listening to podcasts aren't helping and not much about your work life is changing for the better.
 And that's the thing is, is most leaders don't know how to implement what they've learned by reading books or listening to podcasts.
 So assuming that the information was even good. And obviously, you know, this show is good stuff.
 But that's why we created the next level leadership live event.
 So if you feel frustrated or stuck about work these days, go to crissacrittle.com/events. That's crissacrittle.com/events.
 Registration opens December 1st with $500 off every ticket you buy. But that's for a short period of time.
 You'll learn lessons. We practice daily in our business that are only taught at the event or inside of one of our coaching programs.
 And you'll have hours of workshop time as well as access to all of our coaches. So go to crissacrittle.com/events and take advantage of this limited time offer before it slips away.
 Well folks, I hope this encourages you to explore the idea of running a debt-free business.
 Remember, it's not just about the financial benefits, but also the mental and emotional wellbeing that comes with it.
 And yes, if you're already well in debt, how about we talk about some of that on the next episode?
 We'll help you to get there. What does it look like to get out of this?
 We want to hear from you. We'd love to hear your stories your insights. So feel free to share them with us at podcast@christlicardo.com.
 Well that's all the time we have for today. Thank you Joel for joining me.
