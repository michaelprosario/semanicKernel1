 Hey folks, how would you like to be able to predict where your business is going to be next year?
 Better than the weather forecasters actually predict the weather. We are going to talk about that coming up next
 Welcome to the Chris LaCardo Show where we discuss leadership and life and discover that business is what you do
 Not who you are
 Welcome to the show. Hope you're having a fabulous day where you are we are enjoying a great weather day today
 It's a beautiful sunny not too hot not too muggy, so it is nice. Hey listen
 It's no secret that
 in times of crisis
 People tend to make fear-based choices especially when it comes to finances
 That's what we're going to be talking about today is how do you make better?
 How do you better predict your finances and we talked a lot about this on the personal side in episode
 For 28, but here's a deal
 We have seen a lot of
 Up some downs a lot of craziness. I just found out that
 That lumber has been on a
 Downworld word spirally for a while now, which is great to hear you know because that's that was just ridiculous
 The prices that happen there so it's great to hear that it's been I actually like this has been down for a little while
 But the crazy thing when it comes to finances is people have a tendency to make fear-based choices now
 There's a few reasons why maybe it's because they panic
 I don't know if anybody saw lumber prices going up and said hey, I need to go buy a bunch of lumber before it goes in any further
 However, we do see things like you know the gas issues where the gas line went out months ago and and people are I don't know
 I saw a video of a gal putting gasoline in a plastic like shopping bag and then put it in another bag and put it in a trunk now
 I don't even know what to say to that. I don't understand
 Well, I was gonna say I don't understand the logic. I don't think there's any logic to that one
 But I don't understand that except to say that there's panic, right the whole toilet paper ridiculousness
 As if we were all going to run out of toilet paper because for some crazy reason
 Companies would stop making toilet paper the funny thing is people don't think on the on on the backside
 No pun intended, but it worked out be what I'll think on the backside that
 Those companies are gonna keep making toilet paper, but they're not gonna all of a sudden flood the market with toilet paper and then have a huge void
 Wow, I am
 Wow
 I'm just dropping puns in here left and right that you know in their sales because people want ballistic buying up a ton of toilet paper
 Right there wasn't a big lack of
 Ability to make more toilet paper, right there has not been a lack of treats
 There's not been a lack of wood, but people move into these ridiculous panic modes and freak out or maybe they just make rash decisions
 Right, maybe they're just not thinking through
 What is this mean to go spend money here? What is this mean to?
 Make this financial decision right in this moment. Maybe they're just not actually putting enough
 Thought getting enough perspective to it or even like all of the people that were
 Looking to the government to take care of them with stimulus checks. I mean for the love
 Listen, I know a lot of you do not mind that you got stimulus checks, right?
 But I don't think a lot of people actually use that to put food on their table
 I think I I think I saw most people at like Costco where places, you know spending that money like crazy
 How many people have you talked to that use that money to make
 You know new decks or to
 Read to their gardens or go on a vacation? Well probably not a great vacation, but you know still
 Spending that money looking for that bailout
 You know how many companies looked for for bailouts because of the ridiculousness of shutting everything down
 That it affects them and so I had a government needs to take care of them no matter what it is
 We're very aware and if you're not aware by now
 Then you need to be that when it comes to times of crisis and it comes to financial decision making people make things worse
 They make matters worse without the predictability of
 Where your business is going to be and I'm not saying that you can predict exactly where you're gonna be in a crisis
 But you should be able to predict where your business is going we do it all the time
 I've been doing that for decades. I live in my numbers. I'm constantly predicting
 Where are businesses going to be? I push
 Some of my leaders to
 Bring budgets to me for their areas and we work through these things and we make this into a much larger
 Global budget for the company and so I'm always predicting where my business is gonna be
 I know when I'm gonna be able to pay
 Profit sharing I know when something's gonna suck up a whole bunch of of cash, you know, because we have large expenses
 I know these things
 Right and the best part about it is it's huge in
 How I make decisions for my business for my business is?
 Knowing the numbers being able to predict knowing what's coming in knowing what's going up being able to look at my bottom line
 Look at what the needs are we budget future team members we budget you know all kinds of we budget future
 Events there's all kinds of things that we are putting into a forecast
 I'm saying budget because that's the term that most people utilize but once we get past
 Next month it's technically a forecast
 We're constantly forecasting all this stuff so that we know what's going on so I can make better decisions
 So if I look down into my business and I see that I'm you know more cash flush than I thought I was going to be
 I push my leaders what's the next higher?
 What's the next event that we're gonna do? What's the next thing?
 What's another product that we can focus on what's another service that we can focus on?
 What's something different that we can do by building in predictability it allows me to take calculated risks
 By not having that predictability built in that it makes it very difficult to take calculated risks now
 I will tell you I am somebody who is constantly calculating my risks. I take some pretty darn decent size risks
 But I'm always calculating what's going to look like what's going to cost me what's going to you know
 Require in resources what's the potential outcome what's the potential failure?
 You know, I'm always looking at stuff and basing my decision on what are you know?
 What are my what's the probability that I'm going to be successful with this?
 What's the probability that I'm going to not fail miserably?
 I'm not going to have a fatal failure if it goes wrong
 Knowing that my bottom line looks good. I have money. I have resources. I can take a hit if I absolutely have to
 But obviously that's not the goal
 But I know that if I do take a hit that everything's still going to be okay. I'll probably not be happy
 Because you know if I took a hit a lost money, but it allows me to take those calculated risks those are things
 That we need to do on a continuous basis to make sure that we can predict where our business is going to be so
 We're going to talk more about that when we come back right after this
 Hey, it's Joel Fortner here. I'm device president a leadership development on Chris's team and I oversee our next
 sub-mastermind business coaching program
 Most business owners and leaders like a clear path to succeed in business

 and visit Chrisocordo.com/mastermind again Chrisocordo.com/mastermind today
 So folks building predictability is not easy. This is actually hard work. It's the slow and painful
 preparation all along the way that keeps people on course so when storms blow through you're not just like
 blown all over the place you're not second you're not you're not struggling you're not hurting you know
 You might take a a kicking in the teeth but you're gonna be able to make it you're gonna be able to be all right when COVID hit
 obviously it
 Almost
 Destroyed one of our events
 We were not able to do our next level leadership live event in person and that really has a big impact on our
 business for the year
 Praise God we were able to do it virtual still not the same so when we got around to
 Earlier this year it was great to be able to do it in person and have everybody shop and and just powerful just a world of
 Difference it was great to see how much everybody wanted to get out
 It was great that people wanted to come down and and do the event and bring their teams and it was fabulous turn out great
 Why am I telling you all this because
 We are so predictable on where our business is gonna be that when we had the teeth kicking of
 COVID on our event
 We were all right
 Did we lose money? Absolutely we lost a big chunk of money
 But we continued to do what we do and it didn't take us forever to get turned back around
 Proverbs 215 says good planning and hard work lead to prosperity
 But hasty shortcuts lead to poverty
 That's something we live by that's something we understand
 We know and we put a lot of work in effort into so as I'm talking about this and there's a ton that we're gonna get to in fact
 We're not gonna be able to make this in one episode. This is gonna be a two-parter
 As I talk about this I want you to know that it's not easy
 Slow and steady really does win the race as well as prepare us for future emergencies
 You know prepare us for you know being able to predict where we need to spend money where we need to save money
 If we do
 Experience another COVID or something what does that look like so keep in mind that making sure that you're
 Setting up your business for predictability for knowing where it's gonna be it's gonna be more like crock pots not like microwave
 Right we're not looking for that fast
 Answer because it's never really the right answer right we need to really understand this we're looking at
 You know savings plans not jackpots we're looking at
 Diligence we're looking at discipline and if I have not said the word enough there's so many p-words in this whole episode
 If I haven't said the word plan enough lately planning
 So if you want to build predictability into your finances it takes diligence and
 Our 400th P word perseverance
 So what is it all matter
 We did the episode in may called leading by the numbers it was number four six the and I believe
 Or leaders must know their numbers you have to know you have to know what your your finances are telling you
 You have to know where you're spending money you have to know
 You know what is coming in what is your
 Recurring revenue if hopefully you've got some
 Not knowing the numbers keeps you from making quality decisions in your business period
 Period right it's like debt removes options for you right when you're heavily into debt
 That's your option that's it that's all you got going for you when you're not you have tons of options
 Well knowing your numbers it's the same thing when it comes to quality business decision making
 When you do not understand what your numbers are telling you when you do not understand where you're spending money
 When you're spending it who's spending it how it's being spent when you don't know all of this stuff
 It makes it incredibly difficult to make good quality decisions and
 I'm probably gonna throw a bunch of you off here, but a lot of you do not need to be operating in a cruel accounting
 It doesn't get no listen plenty of you should be
 But most of you are probably in a cruel instead of cash basis because you have a CPA who told you you need to be
 And many of you just aren't that size where you don't need to be
 So in other words, it's actually clouting your decision making because you don't understand month by month what comes in and what goes out
 There's times when you are in a cruel where you have booked something and it shows that you have a bunch of money because of the sale and yet you don't have the cash
 There are times you spend a lot of money on expenses, but it doesn't actually show up until you book it to a job
 So there's a lot of stuff when it comes to making good business decisions that you need to have in place
 So that you can make good business decisions and one of those things is
 And probably the most important thing is understanding your numbers now
 To do so means that you gotta be proactive right you can't just be reactive well Chris I've got you know my bottom line is black
 It's not red so I'm pretty happy well
 Okay, but how much better could it be right how much better could it be if you were proactive and really learning and getting to know the numbers and
 Then utilizing that to make decisions nine months off from now
 12 months off from now right knowing what what options you have knowing when you can hire how much it's gonna cost
 What you're gonna spend on computers and furniture and all those things and you know everything that goes along with that
 What if you knew now that you could hire somebody?
 I don't know three four five months from now when up until this point you weren't even planning on any hires
 What if by knowing your numbers you see that you can actually take bigger risks
 One of the things I was just sharing this with one of our great clients that was in for strap land recently
 For us we do strap land once to twice a year depending upon what's going on that year and
 One of the things that we do is we take a look at all of our capacity
 Mine included so we will actually take a look at me as the leader and say you know how much time
 Just Chris have
 What windows are open on his calendar all these things, but we look through the business and we ask ourselves how much money do we have to spend?
 What are the what you know the teams what do they tie up in?
 Is there capacity on the teams is there openings on the calendar?
 Is there time for people to put together a new event?
 Is there time for people to put together new products? We spend time going through in learning the capacity of our own company
 And when we do that then we make decisions that there's one year
 We had a couple team members that are a little bit too excited that like we're probably we're gonna be able to do like three events this next year
 So okay, well, let's set down and work through our process come to find out. We were able to do one
 And it turned out to be a great event. So on top of all of the events that we did in that year
 We were able to slide one extra event in that we had manpower
 That we had money in case it failed that we had opportunity because it was a
 Great event to put out there and
 That the people who were gonna teach it were actually available
 So by doing that by knowing our numbers by knowing all of these things
 We were able to make a really good decision to add a piece to the puzzle that we would not have had
 So that gave us extra revenue it gave us extra net profit it gave us extra clients
 And it didn't hurt us now
 How do we gone for three events that would have taxed the team?
 That means that we would have been able to put on three events
 But probably two or all three would not have been done with excellence because it would have been too much for the team
 So think about it
 By knowing our numbers we didn't go beyond our abilities of providing excellence
 Instead we kept it right where we could we did add we did stretch the team we you know
 We stretched the leader the leader ship as well and it was fantastic. So here's the key thought
 You'll never get to the place where you can really grow your business until you really
 Know your business and I'm talking about inside and out many of you have heard the story of Sam Walton in the
 The days of Walmart and Sam's Club being so huge
 Like the times that he would go out and he would just get to a distribution center and get on a truck somewhere
 And he would tell the driver don't you dare
 Radio in and don't you dare receive any calls if somebody tries to call in
 Just leave the radio alone and Sam would ride on that truck you're that you know where you going
 Going to South Carolina great fantastic and he would spend that time talking to that driver and really getting to know
 What working at Walmart is like for that driver?
 What is the experiencing?
 How's it treating him how are people treating him?
 He would spend time getting to know the driver giving influence as well
 Interestingly enough
 One Sam did not show up at the office. They knew something was up and that's when they would start going through contacting their trucks and the truck that didn't respond back
 They just see where it was headed so sure stuff
 You know would say I would get there when that truck would get to the Walmart
 On the dock would be lined up all the managers inside of that store and he would just look at him and say nope
 I'm not talking to you right now
 We'll talk later and he'd go through the store and he'd talk to the people that are stocking the shelves and he talked to the cashiers
 He talked to the people that were unloading of the dock
 He'd talk to everybody and get a really good idea of what was going on knowing his business inside and out and then
 He would meet with those managers and
 If they needed a butt kick guess what they got it if they're doing a fabulous job he'd let them know that too
 So that's a great example of the importance of
 Understanding your business inside and out by doing so the
 CEO of the business was able to make way better decisions back in his home back in his little town
 By spending time looking at his business from the road and by spending time looking at his business by the front line workers
 So before we dive into how to build predictability let's take a little deeper into the why element
 We're gonna do that right after this
 Hey folks a couple years ago. I was visiting with a client and the CEO said to me Chris
 We're not gonna hit our goal. I asked him what he meant and he said
 We're gonna miss our three year revenue goal coming out of strat plan by a few months
 I didn't realize it at first that he was having a little fun with me by saying they were about to triple their company in less than
 Three years how freaking awesome is that folks these are the kinds of results that businesses get by coming through our four-day
 Stratplan events
 On average we find two point one
 Million dollars worth of revenue in the next 12 months that the company was not planning on
 And this event is for all size businesses if you're small medium or large
 It works for every single business because it's not industry specific
 It's about gaining all the information about all the things inside of your business that are holding you back from success
 And then giving you a plan and a process on how to walk that out and be successful in your business
 By discovering the things that are holding you back
 It helps you get to all of those goals that you've been planning on for a long time
 So if you're ready to get the perspective you need to solve what's holding you and your business back
 So you can grow faster than you need strap land to learn more go to
 Chricero.com/stratplan that's Chricero.com/stratplan
 So every business is like an organism that is made up of interconnected systems
 Right so what do I mean by interconnected systems well
 Like Michael Scott says break it down like I'm five so I'm gonna give that a try
 Even if you are just selling lemonade
 Out there on the front curb right in your driveway whatever
 There is
 Systems that are put together to make that happen right there is the system of actually getting the
 Produced we call fruit produce. I'm sure we do getting the fruit the produce the lemons the sugar the whatever else
 You're putting in that thing
 To make the actual lemonade to sell right there's the process of manufacturing
 Deleminate itself. There's the the distribution process of getting everything pulled together that cups the
 You know the container that's gonna hold the the major portion of the lemonade the
 Napkins if you need I don't know whatever it is whatever it takes
 for you to be able to distribute
 This lemonade right there's the the point of sale system there's the process that actually receives
 The sale itself right then if you're really good
 There is the networking hey go tell all your friends about us
 You know process system of marketing right
 Market your great product two people coming in and then cause them to be walking billboards to tell their friends
 That they gotta come down and get you lemonade because it's so amazing
 There's every bit of
 That going on in your business and most likely a lot more right so it's not like we're just predicting one aspect of the business
 Each system serves the whole
 Corporate entity by their individual functions
 So it's not good enough and I know a lot of people do this they shoot from the hip on their business as a whole
 Making decisions or predicting how things are gonna go and they never dig down into those individual systems and find out
 What's going on?
 How's it working how's it doing is it winning is it failing?
 Right and that's something that we've got to be able to do that's something that we do through
 Stratpline a lot as help people to actually look into their teams
 Or if they've only got one and actually ask the question
 How can you make this better instead of me telling you how it needs to be better?
 What do you experiencing right now what?
 Wisdom do you have what things can you do differently all of those things
 Have to happen if we're going to predict really well
 The better these systems are systematized and maintain yes
 I did just say that all of you high d's out there that are like all crud
 Make and so I can't stand to make systems great get somebody else to do it but make sure that it's done
 Right to huge things that almost every business comes out of Stratpline with is the need for
 Way better processes
 Which we have a massive process on how to do that or and or
 training
 Almost every company is lacking some level of training somewhere inside of the business right
 Why because we don't
 Normally think we don't naturally think we should systematize this right
 How can you make something where it is operating on its own and then how in the world do you maintain it now?
 What we would say is review it not to mind is it but
 Those are things that you need to be successful and when you do these things then the more predictable and manageable the entire
 Organizations outcomes will be it won't just be this number that you keep shooting for which a lot of companies
 Keep basing their success on a number. This is the number we need this is never gonna hit go out to this number guys
 There is so much more to your businesses success
 Than a number and
 The more you focus on all of this predictability
 Then the the outcomes that you're expecting and all of those areas are actually gonna be way greater than you were planning on so for us
 One of our big outcomes is
 Serving people
 What is the success of the person did we get them to the right perspective?
 Did we get them the right information to change their lives to change the business to change their families?
 So as we focus on doing all of those other pieces correctly
 Then we're able to start predicting our outcomes in multiple areas of heck of a lot better
 This means that you can start to really lead and grow your business at a whole new level
 Because now you're not doing the same thing you've been doing that got you to where you are instead
 You're looking big picture
 How do I start tweaking and
 Turning and affecting every aspect of the organization so that I have much bigger outcomes?
 So
 Ready for a gut punch?
 When the systems are not maintained and improved over time right?
 So if you're not going through checking every system optimizing those systems over time
 Then they are unpredictable in volatile which is gonna be yielding and limited profitability
 You will see this the very first time one of those systems starts to break down because it's too old
 Times have changed things have changed people are operating things differently whatever it is
 You'll start to see things breaking down
 Great example that always go back to Jim Collins good to great when he talked about it
 Believe it was Southern Railway that stayed a train company instead of becoming a transportation company
 So while other companies became transportation companies and railway was just part of their portfolio
 Southern Railways stayed the same and obviously if you've ever read that book you know that they I think it was like
 I don't know seven bankrupts user whatever so
 If you don't check these systems in place well first off if you don't put them in place well then that's holding you back
 But it's not just enough to put them in place. You've also got to go through review them maintain them optimize them all it kind of
 stuff
 Businesses who don't do these things
 They tend to implode
 Leaders are usually held captive to the leadership crazy cycle being stuck in the same thing over and over again
 Not really being able to lead people to success and
 Systems tend to be dry they tend to be
 Siloed which is horrible they tend to be
 Unproductive so in conclusion of today. This is gonna be a two-partner
 Sloppy leadership
 Sloppy accountability sloppy systemization leads to inability to truly
 Project that's what we're trying to get to so
 Hopefully this has helped you today. This is a great amount of information on where you might be
 You might be sitting there today going my gosh, I can't predict the future
 I've not been able to predict the future. I've not been able to nail down
 You know when I'm gonna have money when I can make better decisions
 I've not done these things. I definitely don't have the systems in place that I need
 So I'm obviously not optimizing them because they don't exist so we're gonna talk more about those things
 When we hit part two of this and I think that's gonna be in two weeks from now so
 As always take this information
 Change your leadership change your business change your life and
 Systematize your calendar to join us on the next episode
