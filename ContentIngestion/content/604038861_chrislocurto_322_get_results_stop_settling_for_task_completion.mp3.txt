 Is your team task-focused or results-focused?
 How is that affecting their ROI and your bottom line?
 That is coming up next.
 Welcome to the Crystal Acredo Show, where we discuss leadership and life,
 and discover that business is what you do, not who you are.
 Welcome to the show, folks.
 Now, imagine you tell your eight-year-old,
 go to your room and pick everything up off the floor.
 They come down stairs and proudly say, "All done."
 Obviously, you don't question that at all, right?
 You go to check their work and you find that they did,
 in fact, pick up everything on the floor,
 and now it's on their bed, #FaceBomb.
 They accomplished the specific task you asked, but did they deliver
 the results that you were looking for, of course not?
 Now, ask yourself, when it comes to your team,
 when it comes to your business, when it comes to your individual role,
 is there a task-result gap?
 Is there a gap in you doing the tasks that you're doing
 and getting the results that are expected?
 We're going to hit the three steps to get your team driving results,
 instead of just completing tasks.
 But first, I want to tell you about next-level life.
 Next-level life is our two-day personal discovery experience.
 It's a one-on-one personalized event where we guide you through a process
 to help you discover your root system,
 to get unstuck in life and to discover what's holding you back
 from freedom and peace.
 Imagine this.
 What if you could wake up every morning with a clear purpose?
 What would it look like to have healthier relationships with less conflict?
 Where would you be in a few months, a year, five years,
 if you had clarity, purpose, and peace?
 Probably a big difference for more you stand today.
 Now, I know it's possible because I've been where you are asking myself,
 is there more?
 There is, and there is a better way.
 And it starts with next-level life.

 So folks, we're talking about this task result gap,
 but it looks like when you have one.
 Sometimes it can be something like tasks are getting completed,
 but the key performance indicators aren't being hit.
 You don't see the results from the vendors that you were promised you should receive.
 You have team members coming to you seeking for your recommendation on every issue,
 or a change that comes up instead of taking steps to solve it.
 You have team members that don't have a crystal clear picture
 of the goals that they're after and how they affect the mission,
 but they are accomplishing tasks.
 Here's what's happening.
 You or your team are focusing on task and productivity.
 And not necessarily focusing on the desired outcome of the task and the productivity.
 The result of the task is either not being clearly communicated or it's not being clearly led.
 One or the other.
 And another piece to this puzzle is we may even be communicating the results.
 And yet we are not looking to see if the tasks that are being completed
 are actually accomplishing the results.
 You have to measure that.
 That's why we're big on putting in key performance indicators or what we call KPIs.
 Is to make sure that we're actually measuring the result that we're trying to accomplish.
 Now, I can tell you this.
 When we talk to the more task folks on the disc personality profile,
 your high seas, your high ds, having that big picture that result,
 here's what it's supposed to look like, here's what the outcome should look like is incredibly important.
 Because when they can see the outcome, then they can do a much better job of hitting it or know what they're
 supposed to do. However, that still does not solve the problem of the gap between task and results.
 So how do you fix it? How do you close the gap and get the results focus that you need or that you want?
 So there's three steps that we're going to be talking about to get your team driving results instead of
 just completing tasks. One of the big ways to close that gap is by utilizing KRA.
 So when we're looking at the individual team member, one of the things that we want to do is to define
 the result that we're looking for. Many people still mess this up like crazy.
 That's why we put together a big lesson on KRAs is to help them to understand.
 People will put down, well, here's the tasks. Here's the area and here's the tasks.
 It's not the tasks that we're looking for. I'm not saying that you can't have parts of the task in there
 or be mentioned in the task, but a great KRA, which means key result areas.
 The key results that you're looking for in an area in multiple areas, whatever you have for the
 person for the role, that it's not just the task that wins. It's the result of the task that wins.
 It's the understanding of what we're looking for in this area. So you have to understand
 that when you give somebody an assignment, you're putting together a job, you're putting together a specific
 role in your business. You're going to put together a job description. You should have a job
 description. What is a job description? It is the description of the job. It is the tasks and things
 that you need to put in there that they have to know that they have to accomplish. Now you don't have to
 get down to every single nitty gritty task that they're going to do. And if you've explained it
 so much that a monkey can do it, you probably shouldn't be hiring somebody for that role. We do need people
 to think for themselves. But the job description is going to be much heavier in what the job is and what
 you're doing. KPI's are those key performance indicators. It's the measurements. This is powerful.
 This is what we put. And this is one of the many elements that we put into KRA's. Is a KPI. How do
 you measure between the task that they're supposed to be doing and the result that you're expecting?
 What does that look like? You need that measurement in there. That's one of the big pieces that
 closes that gap. Right? So then that leaves the KRA. And the KRA is the result that they should be
 getting or seeing or experiencing because of the job that they're doing. So if we took something like,
 I don't know, let's take a salesperson. Salesperson is a pretty easy KRA because you've got the tasks
 you know what you need to do. The calls, the emails, the conventions, or whatever. And the KPI is
 a pretty simple too because you're looking at numbers. What are the numbers that we're looking for?
 But the result may be something like. So if we're looking at our business. One of our results is
 that everybody must be clearly communicated to about what they're going to receive in this event or in this
 product or or because the last thing we want is any but I'm not here to bust out a whole bunch of money
 by selling products and selling services. I am so glad that that's what we do and we love doing that.
 But our bigger focus is changing lives. And the last thing we wanted somebody to walk and go,
 wow, that didn't change my life. So our focus is that they understand what to expect from this sale.
 If we took a marketing person and we said, okay, we want you to market all of our products. All of our
 services. Part of the results, the KPI is obviously going to be the measurements. This is how many
 leads we're looking for on this product line. And here, this is how much sales we're looking for
 online through this thing over here. But one of the results might be making sure that everybody knows,
 you know, every product that this is based in my belief system, which is Christianity. You know,
 that there is a biblical basis to this. It doesn't mean that people who aren't believers don't do this.
 We have plenty of folks that are not believers that come through our services that listen to us,
 that come to our events, that's great. The reason why is because they know that we're not somebody who's
 going to cram this down their throats and tell them that, you know, if they don't do this, then they can't show up.
 But we do want people to understand that it's biblically based. So that might be a result that we're
 looking for. If it's not communicated, then we have a problem. Those are just a couple of examples.
 It's not, hey, make sure you put this piece of information on the sheet. The result is, if they don't
 know this, if this isn't communicated, that's some way, then you're not achieving the result that we're
 looking for. So if we had a content marketing role, we could have a job description or task that says,
 right weekly content for the email newsletter. We could have a KPI that says generate 50 leads per quarter
 through the email newsletter. We could have a KRA that says that the copy must be compelling and convert
 potential customers into leads for products or services, right? Because the result that we're looking for here
 is that we are converting people. It's not just that the task is done. It's not just that the
 the newsletter is written. It's that we're converting people into the potential customers, right?
 The KPI helps us to narrow that gap. So somebody could come along. You could say, hey, here's what we
 want you to do. And this is what happens in so many situations. Your job is to convert leads through the
 newsletter. So you've got to write a weekly newsletter. And that's it. And then they're not getting
 the result that they want. And the result that they're hoping for was, well, you need to generate 50 leads
 and then we're still not getting it. Well, what do we do? Well, I'm doing the very thing you told
 me to because we did not actually put a stronger result in place that we did not explain a stronger result
 then they're doing the task. They're doing the thing we said do this task over here. But when we look
 at our KPI, what are we discovering? They are not hitting the KPI. We're not getting the result that we
 wanted. We're not getting the numbers that we wanted. Why? Because what we didn't go back into is
 discover whether or not the copy that's being written is actually converting people that it's actually
 working. So we have this gap. We have somebody who's doing the tasks. They've been doing it every week.
 They've been getting that news letter out. But we're not getting the results that we want. And so we go,
 well, you're doing something wrong. Well, what is the piece that's missing? You had to actually stop
 and write, focus the content not being on stuff, not being on information. We had a sales page that we put
 up and we had to take it back down because the sales page didn't sell anything. The result of the
 sales page was to be selling and unfortunately it was all informational. So it didn't actually sell
 anything because there wasn't a sales process on it. It was just information. Surprise, surprise,
 it didn't work. We took it down because we were able to very quickly look at the result that we wanted
 and compare it to the task that was done and see that it did not align with the result. So we have
 to switch this. We have to change this fix this quickly. So implementing carriers and KPIs,
 carriers not only define the result of what they're doing or what we're looking for, but it also shows
 them a week after week after week. What it looks like to actually accomplish this to actually win
 in this role. Carries provide a clear visual. It's a document for what is expected. So we have both
 parties on it. Make sure everybody's on the same page that we all understand that this is what we're
 looking for. This is the result and we also have an outline for KPIs on almost every single team member
 role. Every role we can put KPIs on even if it's an admin role. If there is something that we can
 measure, we're putting it on that. Number two, you have to paint the vision. How often are you just doing
 the task on your plate instead of leading somebody or being led to the vision? You have to paint the
 vision for your team. When the project kicks off or when you're working with a specific client or when
 you're starting a new role, whatever it is, you have to paint the vision of where they're going. Now for
 me, this is a very simple process that we do. Mission is your purpose. Vision is where you're headed.
 So here's an example that I use all the time. Everybody's been to the beach or everybody's been to
 the mountains. So imagine, pick a place that you've been to on vacation and think of what it's
 like to go there. So if it's the beach, let's say it's the beach. You know what you're going to do.
 You know what it's going to look like when you get there. You know what the water's going to look like.
 You know what the sand's going to look like. You know the rest. You're going to eat that. You know
 that you're going to be toss on a frisbee or lying out and get in the tent. Whatever that is,
 whatever it looks like when you're there, that's the vision. That's the destination. That's where you're
 headed. That is what you need to paint for your team. When they're doing a project, that's what you
 need to paint for a team member when they come on board. That's what you need to paint business
 owners. You should be painting this for your whole business. Guys, this is the direction where
 you're heading in. Every single piece of this, whatever it is, if you will paint the vision, it helps
 people to close that gap between what they're supposed to do task wise and what the result is expected
 to be. Now, I can tell you very quickly, and this happens a lot through Stratpline. We'll get a lot of
 companies in here that have no painted vision. And so they have this shotgun approach. We're
 different aspects of the company, are going in different directions. They do not have a unified vision.
 They do not have a unified direction. And by the time we're done, we're pointing them at,
 it's this pointy arrow. Go that way. And it's drawing people back because when we are unified
 in the direction that we're going in, oh my gosh, we see momentum. Oh my gosh, we see productivity.
 But when you have people going in different directions, they're not aligned. They're not into the same
 mission. Then it's like, you know, hurting cats. You are not getting anywhere near the productivity that
 you want. And you're definitely not getting the productivity on a specific area, a specific focus,
 a specific brand, whatever that is. So be painting the picture all the time. Now before we get to the third
 step, I have to tell you about our next level leadership live event. And you only have a week.
 There's only a week left, April 24th at midnight. That's when tickets close. I've never seen a
 leader that's had everything that they wanted. Out of thousands of leaders that I've coached, most are
 probably a lot like you. You wish you saw greater productivity unless drama from your team that you didn't
 spend your energy putting out fires that you had more time to invest in your family and the things that
 you enjoy and you felt more equipped to lead your team to success. The only thing that's holding
 leaders back from the results they desire is having the right tools. And you can get those tools at the
 next level leadership live event. So if you're young, old, new, experienced, struggling or really
 successful, this event is for anyone who is ready to learn from 25 years of best practices that get
 proven results. It's not about short term fixes. In three days, I'm going to teach you how to have sustained
 revenue growth to generate greater productivity from your team and get immediate momentum toward the
 results that you want. It's going to be detailed, practical and loaded with how to's from the lessons
 we're teaching our clients have seen an average of 46% increase in gross profit in one year's time. That's
 one year's time. These clients are a normal, everyday businesses and your business can have the same level of success.
 So if you're ready to see those results, go to crissacrido.com/events and get your tell to this event
 and invest in your leadership and your business that's crissacrido.com/events. I can't wait to see you there.
 Okay, we're talking about the third thing that you can do to stop settling for task completion,
 to get the results that you want. The third thing that you need to do is evaluate an implement
 accountability. Now, if there's clarity on KRAs, KPIs, and they're being led well, the task result
 gap should close. If you have shown them what the result looks like. If you've shown them the measurements
 of how to get there, if you have gone in and painted this vision, the gap should be really
 closed. It should be done well. However, you still need to hold your team accountable to the results.
 So you don't put somebody in place and have them do task task task task task task task and then go,
 did you hit the results? Well, I did the task, but did you hit the results? Well, I don't know.
 You tell me, it doesn't look like you did. You've got to get in there. If you didn't get the
 results from implementing step one and two, you have to ask the question why not. So again,
 we use a simple example of using KRAs. And again, I'm using KRAs, but guys take projects
 swap this out for a project that you're doing for a client, right? Schedule recurring meetings on
 the KRA review. Now for us, the way we do it here and we teach in the KRA lesson,
 is that you should be reviewing the KRA every single month when somebody starts.
 Until they're getting the results you want and then start spacing it out every two months,
 maybe once a quarter, no less than twice a year. Should you be reviewing that KRA? The only
 time that I actually ever say once a year is if somebody does the most static role and their hit and
 the results every single day, I mean it's just somebody does a go back to the times when we used to
 do events and we had paper tickets. I had a fantastic gal that would sit there and stuff these envelopes
 with tickets. That's what she did for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours.
 That was it. So it wasn't like there was a whole lot and I know everybody out there who's not a high sea is like,
 couldn't do that. All the high seas are like, yeah, I could totally do that. It takes a high sea to be
 able to do this, right? That might be something if somebody does that all day, every day, it's the same thing
 over and over and over and over again, then maybe once a year, but even then, I'd still really
 consider twice a year. So schedule those recurring meetings. It's the same thing if it's again,
 swap this out from KRAs to a project. Schedule the recurring meetings to discuss and see, are we hitting
 the results right now? So let's say you have somebody who's dealing with clients and their brand
 spanking you, then you're discussing with them their results. Often, it might be weekly,
 definitely no less than monthly, right? Until you can see that they are being very successful at
 nailing that and then from there, you can actually start to move that out. When you know that you've got it,
 you know they're doing a great job, then you can start backing it out and backing it out and backing it out.
 But you never stop holding them accountable. So make sure that you're setting the meetings,
 make sure that it's not about the tasks. Don't get in that meeting and discuss tasks,
 discuss the results, discuss the vision. Make sure that you empower them, make sure that you empower them
 to winning contribute to the mission based on their KRA. Right? Hey, you can make decisions here. Hey,
 you can you can jump and push back here. If you don't feel like the things that we have, if we've not
 set the sub well and it's not going to get the results that we're telling you that we want,
 you're empowered to push back. You're empowered to question. You're empowered to, you know,
 whatever, fill in the blank. So make sure that you empower them in the process as well. Make sure
 that you're holding them accountable to their KPIs. So if it's on their KRA, that's one thing. If it's a project,
 what are the KPIs? We should be getting this result for the client by here. We should be getting this result by here.
 This result, this result, this result. What are those key performance indicators of
 accomplishing the result that we're looking for? Also make sure that you have accountability for
 leadership on leading team members to see the results, you know, getting clarity on their KRAs,
 KPIs, on the project that they're working on. So if you have leaders under you, are they doing a great
 job of leading this process? If you've not been doing it, then I can promise you they've not been doing it.
 So make sure that you hold your leaders accountable and you will be amazed at what happens when you do that.
 So get clarity, get your KRAs done, so you can start leading to results instead of tasks. Your team should
 be focused on what results they're accomplishing instead of putting a check mark by the task and
 calling it a day. So we're also going to put more KRA resources in the show notes for you. So make sure
 you check out the show notes. Now next week, folks, we have a fantastic episode on leadership transformation.
