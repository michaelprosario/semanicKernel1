 [Music]
 Welcome to the Chris LaCardau Show, where we discuss leadership and life and discover that
 business is what you do not who you are.
 Welcome to the show folks.
 We hope you're having a fabulous day wherever you are.
 Kind of a dreary, raining, overcast.
 Well, it's actually not raining anymore, but it's still a great day and it is a great day
 because joining me in the studio is Brian Alex.
 So today we're doing something a little bit different.
 This is 1000% unscripted unprepared, as I smack my mic.
 Look at that.
 Even that's unprepared.
 Brian has a question.
 So today's episode, Chris, I've got lots of questions.
 Today's episode is conversations with Brian Alex.
 A little mic.
 I think our ratings just plummeted right there.
 Oh, oops. Oh well.
 So here's what we're going to do.
 We actually sat down to cut another episode and you asked questions.
 I'm like, you know what?
 Let's just turn on mics and have this conversation
 because I think it's a great question that a lot of people need to hear.
 And it's a different angle from a lot of the stuff that we've talked about.
 So let me turn it over to you.
 Yeah.
 So, you know, going back through some of the podcast that we've done over the years.
 And things that we talk about here in the office all the time and in the next level of life,
 especially, is the idea of self-sabotage.
 And how we trip ourselves up where our own worst enemies.
 And I was thinking about this week, I read a quote.
 I'll say the quote.
 And then we'll get into a little bit of how does this actually function in everyday life.
 But for the context, here's the quote.
 This is, it's actually from anyogram, which is another take on personality styles.
 And it's targeted to certain aspects or certain angles on that.
 But I think it's pretty universal and maybe you'll connect with what I'm saying here.
 Here's the quote.
 We're given more than enough energy to transform ourselves every day.
 Okay, but what happens?
 But we waste 99% of it on tensions, on emotional reactions that are unrelated to what's actually occurring
 and on daydreaming and mental chatter.
 And I have to tell you, it was, and I was just pierced right to the heart because I thought,
 "Man, that is me in so many ways."
 Yeah, absolutely.
 So I'm looking at that and going, okay, I know we've dealt with self-sabotage
 and that we've got several episodes, great episodes in 2020 alone on negative self-talk
 and how to get out of those patterns.
 But the things that hit me was the emotional reactions unrelated to what's actually occurring.
 And so where my mind went was, I take a walk every day, I try, get outside and nature
 and let my brain unravel a bit, deschool, I'm a tightly wound dc.
 And so I got to have this little down time and I notice that my mind will start
 concocting imaginary conversations, imaginary arguments and I'm wasting a lot of emotional energy
 and I'll come back from a walk sometimes, I'm actually more wound up than I started out
 and I'll catch myself on a good day and I'll, you know, go right to my thinking and go,
 okay, this is completely non-factual, none of this has happened, you're just spooling yourself
 up in your mind, just stop, just cut it out, stop and I kind of catch myself, right?
 But how many times a day do we do this kind of thing?
 I mean, it's a striking comment, 99% of our energy to change, to transform, to grow, gets wasted
 on these tensions and emotional reactions.
 So let's unpack that a little bit. First of all, I want to hear, I'm not crazy.
 Well, you're not going to get that on this show, right?
 What did you come to the wrong studio?
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
 I've not been bettering themselves, but instead spending time with, you know, and we'll go through
 each one of these, you probably have to have you remind me of which pieces, but like just taking the concept of the
 negative self-talk, the preparing yourself for arguments or battles and things inside of your head.
 We talk about that a lot here, we talk about what fear actually is, you know, we've had a lot of episodes on fear,
 where we've talked about what is fear.
 Fear is assuming or presuming or projecting something that's going to happen, that's not happened yet.
 It's focusing on something as if it is going to happen or could happen or might happen,
 instead of the fact hasn't even happened.
 Now, if you think about it, like you said,
 "Titly wound CD, DC persona, I love that concept, or I love that comment, because there's a part of you,
 you can go from processing incredibly fast to processing incredibly slow, right?
 I like to say that the gears move slowly, but they grind finely.
 Yes, it is a fine grind.
 It's a fine grind.
 Yes, it's a espresso.
 So here you go.
 Wow, that's actually a good timing.
 So the concept, or actually what I'm saying to that, is that you have the ability to think fast,
 but when you're stuck in that slow processing mode, what happens is you can get behind,
 like, so if you're assuming an argument, well, an argument's with another person,
 which means that in that walking time you're coming up with this thought process of,
 well, when I face so and so next, here's what could happen, or here's what they could say,
 or how many times are you now having an argument post?
 Yeah, that's the George Costanza syndrome, right?
 Because he would always come up with the best response as a sign fell,
 but he'd come up with the best response after the argument was over, and he'd just kick himself.
 Right?
 That's a classic, I see an even highest process, right?
 And why is that the thing?
 Because the processing is so much slower that usually you're trying to handle the situation
 that's coming actually instead of pausing, because you may even, like,
 if you're dealing with a high-deer, a high-eye that's pushing,
 then you may not know that you have the ability to go stop, slow down.
 Let me think about that. What is my answer? What should I think, right?
 And so for me, I'm a really high-ess, and so I have that same processing.
 I can process really fast because I use the tools that we teach, which changes the way that I think.
 But I still end up thinking about, oh, you know what I could have said?
 I could have said this, right?
 But the key is that's usually only happening when I'm feeling out of control in a conversation,
 which if I am not getting my worth from God, and I'm all of a sudden gaining or losing worth by now the human being,
 that's where I'm going to be. Well, that's 100% of the people on the planet, right?
 So when you look about at those conversations that you're having or you're feeling behind the April,
 then what happens is you walk away knowing that you're unsatisfied.
 That you still feel out of control, that you don't feel like you said the best things that you could have done something differently.
 And all of a sudden the tape starts, you know you didn't do that as good as you could have.
 You know that you gave away some ground, and all of this crap in lies start happening where you know you're not good enough because you didn't have a good enough conversation.
 You didn't win that conversation. You didn't control that conversation.
 You let go of control. You were frustrated, whatever the negative, you know self-talk is.
 So later on, when it pops up, what we tend to do is walk through what could I have done.
 Now that my brains able to process, and I don't have the pressure of the conversation, what could I have done,
 and we start going through all of this junk.
 I will tell you most of the time, it's always the time.
 Because most of the time, what are you bent on doing? How could I have one instead of,
 so I'm just like everybody else, I will have that moment,
 but instead of focusing on how could I have one that winning is not my focus,
 what would have been a healthier version of that conversation?
 What could I have said, not said, and I will spend time in prayer.
 There's time, and this doesn't have it a lot, but when it does happen,
 I will go, all right, Lord, help me to see what I should have said.
 Help me to see instead of, oh, here's what I could have done, or here's what I,
 I could have swung this harder, I could have said this, I could have whatever.
 Instead, I'm going to God saying, Lord, what was the right conversation?
 If that wasn't 100% right, what am I missing?
 Teach me, you know, growing, because what's the alternative?
 It's the very thing that you read in that comment. The alternative is to stay wasting my energy
 on figuring out how I could have won a conversation.
 It's such a waste of time.
 It's exhausting, and it's a spiral. I know one of our podcast episodes that we had,
 gosh, this would have been, it's episode 269, how to break the self-sabotage spiral.
 It is, it is like that, and it has this centrifugal force that keeps you in this little
 eddy, just spinning round and round, and at the end you're exhausted.
 So if I'm hearing you correctly, there's some self-awareness that we need to understand,
 okay, what's happening in my head right now? Why am I feeling this way?
 And we judge it with the lies in the truth to understand, okay,
 is this factor as a fiction? And if it's fiction, we need to, it needs to go,
 because we're just creating these episodes in our minds,
 and getting exhausted in the process, but it's not a helpful process.
 We talk a lot about failure and learning from our failure.
 And we have a process for that.
 And we walk through that process not to just beat ourselves up about that we failed,
 but we comb through those things so that we understand why it happened,
 how it happened, how it happened, and how to make sure it doesn't happen again.
 There's some growth and some benefit, some fruit that comes out of that kind of self-awareness.
 So how do I get there with getting stuck like this?
 I need that self-awareness first of all, and there's this battle of truth and lies, fact and fiction.
 I'm going to get rid of the fiction, I'm going to stick to facts, okay,
 this is what happened or not happened or hadn't happened yet,
 but from there I don't want to say stuck.
 And I'm emotionally charged at this point because it's just been going through my head,
 I tell myself to stop.
 And I like what you said about making sure that we're rooted in our identity.
 That's maybe that's a first kind of step of, okay, hold on.
 I'm getting way too emotionally invested here.
 I'm getting exhausted, come back to, let's say, let's call this truth and reality.
 I'm a child of God.
 I'm loved, I'm accepted, I find my worth and him,
 and if my worth has been extended out to winning this battle with somebody else or something else,
 then I'm way out of line, I got to pull myself back into my own boundaries.
 Yeah, so a couple of keys to that.
 One is you have to recognize the adrenaline response inside of your body, right?
 Big.
 The moment that is such a huge red flag, I'm struggling.
 This is where you would call it out of control.
 Yes, and for us sees that don't like things.
 See, it's for control.
 That's my always in control.
 No, but understanding, okay, that's me feeling out of control and just recognizing that, that's very helpful.
 That's so cool.
 And it's such a great thing, like you said, a point out for high seas.
 If you say to a CD, you feel out of control.
 No.
 What do you feel frustrated?
 Right.
 Okay.
 Why are you frustrated?
 Because this thing's happening.
 I can't do anything about it.
 So you're out of control.
 No.
 You know, that's right.
 It's all definition to the person.
 Right.
 It's recognizing, oh, maybe I do feel out of control.
 So when you, when you can see the physical response that your first biggest red flag,
 I'm struggling with adrenaline.
 I'm struggling emotionally.
 I'm struggling with wanting to about all those pieces.
 Here's the key.
 The whole point, if correct me if I'm wrong on the comment, I don't have it in front of me.
 But correct me if I'm wrong the beginning of this is to say instead of spending time bettering ourselves.
 Right.
 If, yeah, it was, we're given more than enough energy to transform, to change, to grow ourselves every day.
 Right.
 And here's what we spend time doing in that scenario.
 We spend time trying to figure out how to win a battle against another human being.
 Right.
 So just think about that first.
 I can write, what am I doing?
 I'm now spending to how could I have said that better?
 What could I have done?
 What words could I be?
 How could I have pushed back?
 How could I all this up?
 Because then I'm going to feel better about myself.
 Totally.
 I will feel so much better if I win the battle.
 What a lie.
 Oh, it's such a crazy lie.
 It's such terrible BS.
 Right.
 So for example, I was using a vendor recently, and I'm not going to give you the name of who it was.
 But I was trying to get this Wi-Fi hotspot thing to work out.
 So I went to this place and I had a conversation with the store manager.
 And one of the team members.
 I started out with the one of the team members, and then the store manager jumped into the conversation.
 And so I'm asking the question, will this get a certain level of speed?
 I had a one gig hotspot, and I'm like, you know, if I go with you guys, can I get up to the speed?
 He's like, well, you know, I think ours is really good.
 You can use our unit, but that one should do really good.
 I'm like, well, what should you just get to?
 Because I'm like 300 gigs, and I'm like, okay.
 So I should be able to get to something around our 300 megs.
 300 gigs, that would be fantastic.
 So I should be able to get to something around there.
 You say, yeah, absolutely.
 So I go, I test it out, not even remotely close.
 And so I come back to have the conversation.
 I'm like, at this point, maybe I don't have the right plan.
 Maybe I'd mess something up.
 So I come in and source, hey, you know, I'm talking to you.
 We can have a go.
 You know, I got this unit here, and I got the card from you guys.
 And, you know, we were talking about speed.
 This is a one gig hotspot.
 And we were talking about speeds because I didn't tell you you can get a gig.
 I have not even finished what I'm going to say.
 I didn't tell you you can get a gig.
 You know, I haven't started your question.
 Yeah, not even started.
 I'm like, well, we actually had a conversation.
 I did not tell you that.
 And he starts this thing.
 And I just stand there and he goes on just railing about how he did.
 There's no way he would ever tell me this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, he still doesn't even know what I'm going to say.
 Which the conversation did get to that we should get around two to three hundred megs,
 which that's neither here nor there.
 My ultimate thing that I was going to say is, do I have the wrong plan?
 We never get to that.
 So I'm just standing there and this guy is just going off.
 Well, here's a deal.
 What do we do in those situations?
 We immediately start preparing our battle.
 Right.
 We immediately start our argument.
 Our limit pressure events that everything's going on.
 And this guy's going and going and going and going and I'm just standing there.
 I've already moved past this conversation in my mind.
 Why?
 Because I'm not losing worth.
 I have no plan on battling in.
 Why?
 Because I would be wasting my energy in my time in an argument with somebody who still doesn't even know what the crap is going to say.
 So instead, now I'm just done with your company.
 Yeah.
 So he's going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and he stops for a second.
 I look at how my go, are you okay?
 He just kind of wasn't expecting that.
 And he shakes his head because I just don't like being accused of saying something.
 And I still do not jump in and go, well, I wasn't going to.
 I don't have to be right.
 This is what we talk about in next-level life.
 It's about fighting in a wet paper bag.
 Exactly.
 This is what he's doing.
 And he's just unraveling right there.
 He's so out of control in this moment.
 Well, if I emotionally handcuffed myself to this, it's not even an argument because I'm not arguing.
 I'm not participating in this.
 But if I emotionally handcuffed myself to this situation, I will battle.
 I will argue.
 I will come up with something.
 So I will say, you're not even listening to me, man.
 You don't even know what the thing is.
 And instead, I'm said, are they going, do I want to waste my time with this?
 No, I do not.
 Absolutely don't waste my time with this.
 So instead, I just go, so, can I get a refund?
 Do you want to just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just,

 The second thing is what is my intention with processing through this?
 If my intention with processing through this to win, then I can promise you I'm going
 to lose.
 That's great.
 All right.
 What is the cost of getting unstuck in these areas and getting to freedom coming up right
 after this?
 Hey folks, if you're feeling stuck, anxious, not good enough or held back in life, then you
 need to go through our next level life.
 That's why we created this two day event process.
 The power of next level life is that it helps you discover your specific root system,
 while you believe what you do, how you make decisions, and why you are where you are in life.
 You learn the things that are holding you back in life and how to overcome them.
 You'll come away having found healing and ready to start living with purpose and authenticity.
 So if you're ready to stop struggling, if you're ready to find greater peace, then head over to
 ChrisLicord.com/nextlevellife.
 The next level life is waiting for you.
 That's ChrisLicord.com/nextlevellife today.
 All right.
 So coming back around a couple of pieces just to kind of capitalize on so that we don't lose them
 here.
 So that's a practical that is Chris where there's some self-awareness going on.
 We're checking in with the body because that's a good indication of what's going on
 internally.
 Some of that internal dialogue and even the unspoken.
 Because sometimes if I'm in that grinding the C mode, I don't really cognizantly know
 or wouldn't be able to articulate exactly what I'm feeling or why.
 And so I'm having to pause and this is where learning some self-awareness is super helpful.
 And sometimes we have to slow down just like he said and go, "Okay, why am I feeling this way?
 I'm feeling just generically happy, sad, depressed, whatever."
 But then understanding why and then what's my intention?
 That was excellent.
 What's my intention with processing through this?
 I love this quote by Jordan Peterson. He says, "Virtually every freedom you have in life is purchased
 at the price of discipline."
 And so thinking about these other little pieces here from that original quote,
 talking about how we waste our transformative energy, our growth energy, our change energy,
 on all these other little things, imaginary and whatnot.
 Some of the other little pieces were about daydreaming and mental chatter.
 Wow, where do we go from here? How do we build in that discipline to get to the freedom and away from
 just all of the blur of social media and all the mental chatter that goes on inside of our head?
 It's all the daydreaming.
 So if you think about Jordan Peterson, here's a guy who puts himself in situations where people just attack him.
 I mean, he literally puts himself in interviews and debates and things where people, I'm sorry,
 but sound like it is.
 But they're coming out of us, stuff that is just like that.
 Do you hear what you even just said?
 And I'm sitting there watching them and I'm crying going, "This dude is my hero."
 Look at how he is maintaining his composure.
 He's sticking to the facts and I'm thinking, "I want to do that. I want to be like that."
 Well, the discipline that he's speaking to is exactly how we got to that place.
 When you look at what a lot of the general public is doing nowadays, they're choosing to jump on pan wagons on a consistent surface.
 If you just open up social media for five minutes, which you'll see is a lot of people that are jumping on this pan wagons of "Oh, this thing is right."
 Oh, this thing, I should say this too. Oh, I believe this instead of actually asking themselves, "What do I think about this?
 What do I feel? Do I have all the information? Do I have enough perspective?"
 So when our society is moving in this direction of grabhold of something, jump on that pan wagons and start pick up a megaphone and start screaming at the top of your lungs as well,
 then it's not surprising that people aren't disciplined enough to have a conversation.
 There's no filters anymore. No process of thinking through our response.
 So when you see the folks, if you just watch the people who ask questions of people like Jordan Peterson, some of these folks that do this,
 get out there on these campuses and do these debates on all that kind of stuff, Ben Shapiro. Ben Shapiro, a fantastic one.
 Nation-villian now. He's now a Nation-villian, absolutely. We've got a lot of folks that have actually moved this direction, can't afford to sell in this move this direction, but we have.
 So when you look at that process, if you watch the person asking the question, you can see a couple of things happening,
 but one of the major things that's happening of the person asking the question is that they're feeling out of control in their question, and they're trying to control Jordan.
 They're trying to control Ben, they're trying to control Candace.
 They're saying that, "Well, you said this and you believe this and they're setting realities, right?"
 And almost every single time you'll see the person come back and go, "That's actually not what we'll say. That's out of context."
 You miss this piece. And the person who's trying to win is choosing to take this controlling tact to say, "This is where you are. Let me first put you in your place."
 Right. I'm going to frame it up. I'm going to set your reality. This is what happened. How are you going to dig your way out now?
 They feel so good. That's actually not what we said. Then what happens is that now they're in this back pedal struggle. Why is this happening?
 Why do we do this type of stuff? Because instead of proactively focusing on how to add better myself, we spend too much time focusing on how to add when it's there.
 How do I control stuff? So with the rest of the comment of, "We spend a lot of time day dreaming."
 It's not that that's horrible. I need time to day dream. I need time to just think through stuff and compress.
 But as Jordan speaking to, if you're going to be in a place where you can have your composure, if you're going to be in a place, we speak about it all the time from the side of the earth.
 If you are actually truly getting your worth from God, not saying that you do, which most Christians say, "Oh, yeah, I know my worth."
 No, you don't. You actually get in and find out and see what he truly says and then you have to live that out. You have to practice, what does it mean to be a citizen of heaven?
 What does it mean to be a son or daughter of the most high-king? What does it mean to be obedient to your father because he's asked you to be? Not living your life in saying that you're a disciple of Jesus when you're the further thing from it.
 What does it mean to actually walk those things out? All of that is discipline. Every single bit of it is discipline. So if you're going to better yourself, you have to ask yourself the question, what's holding me back? What's keeping me from doing this?
 So for me, a lot of times in my thought processes, I will ask myself, what am I trying to accomplish right now? What is my struggle? What am I experiencing?
 Those are great clarifying statements that we use a lot when we're talking with other people.
 We've dealt with that on several episodes about gaining perspective, but even asking that of ourselves in our internal dialogue is helpful clarifying.
 It really helps us to focus when we ask ourselves, when I ask myself, Brian, what are you trying to do right now?
 I have two major areas of the prefrontal cortex. You have the decision making area or what I like to say, the better decision making area. And then you have the desire reward section of your brain.
 When we're out on a walk and we're trying to figure out how we can battle something that hasn't even happened yet, we're in that desire reward.
 As long as we're in that desire reward, will power self-control is out the window, which is why you show back up after you're going, I feel more stressed than I did when I left.
 Why? Because in your brain, how do I win? How do I get the reward? How do I get the thing that I desire? How do I make the thing happen?
 Self-control is out of the way. So, growth is out of the way. So, being able to be disciplined is out of the way. Because you're emotionally focusing on the desire.
 If you're able to go desire desire desire desire desire desire, what the crap am I doing? Why am I thinking this? Why am I focused on this? Why am I building this up? Why am I having an argument about something that's never happened?
 Now, all of a sudden, you're able to shift over into that better decision-making mode and go, "Oh, wow, okay. Take a look at what you're doing then. You're working yourself up. You're stressing yourself. You have this negative self-talk.
 Let's discover why. Why am I saying those things? Why am I, I'm obviously losing worth. If I wasn't losing worth, I wouldn't be having an argument in my own head.
 You know, preparing an argument about all for the future unless I'm already losing worth. Why am I losing worth? Because this thing happened. Why did I lose worth?
 In that situation. Where does my worth actually come from? And so then you start battling the lines with the truths, the negative self-talk with the truths.
 And if you can become honest with yourself, wow, I sucked in that debate. I sucked in that argument. Or wow, that wasn't actually even an argument.
 Somebody was just trying, "I'm not a victim." That's one of the things that whenever I ever get in that mode, if ever, let me say, "I try every single time."
 I'm sure there's times that I'd miss it. But when I get into a victim way of thinking, I will say, and I've shared this before, knock it off, or shut up, because that's a shock my brain.
 I'm going to jar you.
 Exactly. Jarby and go, you're not a victim.
 Knock out the victim, think it. You're not a victim. Solve this. Do something. Fix this.
 That discipline is what's allowed me to live my life doing this. So understand the first half of my life was that desire reward.
 Was that battle for better argument? Was that battle to win?
 Not a lot. I was a super huge people, please. How could I have won that person over? That was more my way of how could I have won that person over? What could I have said that would have won?
 That was the opposite of that. The Dale Carnegie had a win for instance. He was probably not listening because he's in a foreign country and doesn't know how to do podcasts.
 I'm not here to win friends. I'm just here to influence people.
 I'm not here to influence people.
 What's the concept? If you can remove the self-the-puffing up of I really don't care about what you think about me. Otherwise you would have never said that.
 If you look at it from the literal aspect of if you're trying to win friends you're going to fail. If you try to influence then maybe you can help somebody.
 If you go out to find friends you'll find a few friends. If you go out to be a friend you'll find many. All of my fact checkers out there. I screw up sick.
 It's pretty darn close to that. If I'm going to go and find friends what's the problem. If I go be a friend that's a different story.
 I want to be a friend because they want the approval. They want the validation and relationships. They're on both sides.
 What's the problem? What's the problem? What's driving me here? Either to win that argument in my head or the people pleasing on the other side.
 We need to say how do I come back to a balance to the middle of the road to a place of being in control in the sense of I'm controlling my own thoughts and faculties.
 I'm going to have a little bit of a feeling of being in control. I'm going to have a little bit of a feeling of being in control.
 I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm
 If you look at the freedom side of it, I'm completely understand and agree with where Jordan is going.
 Here's where I want to make a slight adjustment. The discipline will get you to some freedoms, but even when you have the discipline.
 What do we teach in the next level of life? We discover the lies that people tell themselves because they think they don't like themselves. We have a whole sheet full of them because we all do it.
 We understand why we tell ourselves the lies. We go to the truth to that why. That's the bigger piece. It takes a process to walk through that, but it's very powerful.
 It does that mean that I'm going to be free of negative self-talk. It does not. What the discipline means is that I will be able to control the negative self-talk which gives me freedom.
 I will be able to control the lies which gives me freedom. Because you've got the tools to handle it when it comes.
 You can have a huge change in a day and a day and a day. But then there's the practice of it because you can have a huge change. But then if you don't practice it, it can go back to normal or worse.
 Here's the piece of the discipline that I believe they're trying to say. I'm going to put words in their mouths.
 Correct us if we're wrong, Jordan, Jacob, please email us in or come join us on the show. If I'm disciplined, then because I'm disciplined, it doesn't mean that the things aren't going to come up.
 It means that I will be able to work through the thing that affords me to be free on the other side. So in other words, let me rephrase it.
 I'm never going to be free of negative self-talk or lies until I transition from this life to the next.
 It is here. God is very clear from the moment of our awakening, we have evil inclinations. That crap exists. So since I will never be free of it, what is the smartest thing for me to do?
 Practice, practice, practice, discipline, discipline, discipline, learn how to get over as fast as possible.
 I love that. And you've said that before that you've worked through this so many times and you're so familiar with those same routines that you get through it faster and faster each time.
 So I think the hope there is that as we employ the tools that we're talking about today and that we do in next level of life, what we talk about on the show here day in and day out.
 When we employ those tools, our skills that grows, our capacity grows, our speed at getting to that, let's call it that free place improves over time.
 I think that's wonderful. I love that we hit on the episode or the scene rather where you were at the vendor and had that conversation because that actually segways into a companion episode that I'm really excited about.
 I don't know where it's going to fall either before or behind this episode, but we'll see.
 But you want to get the both angles here because in this episode, we're talking a little bit more about the internal dialogue and how to keep ourselves in check.
 In the next one, which is going to be called confrontation, conflict and control, we're actually going to deal with more of the exterior side of this and how to deal with controlling people.
 Because conflict is pretty much unavoidable and yet it seems that it gets more and more and more opportunities to be confrontational in the world that we live in.
 So I love that we're dealing with both of these, both the internal side keeping ourselves at rest in a place of peace or a place of freedom.
 But then also we're going to learn how to deal with these people that are out of control, but I still have to live here.
 I still have work to do. You still had a goal in mind which was either resolved the issue or get the refund.
 And how did you maintain your composure and all of that? So we're going to get into that on that companion episode.
 Absolutely. So I want to go back to the quote. I hadn't read the quote again, if you would.
 Yep. So we are given more than enough energy to transform ourselves every day, but we waste 99% of it on tensions on emotional reactions unrelated to what's actually occurring in on day dreaming and mental chatter.
 We literally could spend another hour talking about, I mean there's so many things that we didn't get to, right? It's such a great quote.
 Again, I'm going to push back on the 99, but I don't, on everybody, not everybody is that way.
 So the last thing I want to hit is it, that's a two-part of one. Again, it's okay to have times of day dreaming.
 It's like a balance. If you want to better yourself, then you have to parse your time out of what you do with your brain.
 Yeah. So where is it keeping me from change and transformation and growth? Those are the questions I have to be asked.
 Exactly. If you spend, just take a look at how much time you spend on your phone, your computer, TV, just get some decent average in your mind.
 And ask yourself, if I just cut that in half, right? What does that give me time to do?
 Or first of all, is it worth it?
 Right. Exactly. For whatever X amount of hours I spent last week on social media, my phone, TV, what have you, was it worth it?
 What did I get out of that?
 Yeah, how does that matter?
 Value.
 Right.
 I think we've heard a lot of people say how much they've unfriended people negative. I mean, I went through and had to get, I had people I love.
 But man, there was so much negative crap. I'm just like, got to get rid of it. I can't. I can't have that influence in my brain. Why?
 Because it's now influenced by brain.
 And keeping us back.
 Keeping you back in me back.
 Yeah. So instead of the desire or reward of jumping on their banwagon for me, I'm going,
 I just don't need it. Just remove it. Just make a smarter, better decision.
 So if you take a look at the time, if you cut it back, and I'm not saying that you can't have time, that is not what I'm saying.
 I'm not saying you can't sit down and watch a movie. I'm not saying that.
 There are times we run so hard that there are times my brain just needs to stop sizzling.
 And I just need something to stare at just to keep from thinking.
 Which doesn't happen.
 But anyways, you get the idea.
 What the point that I'm making is, is all those times we're choosing that, and it's not a therapeutic process.
 Right?
 We're doing it because it is force of habit.
 Stay on my phone. Watch TV.
 Screw around on my computer. Whatever the thing is, that instead of doing something or spending time with friends that aren't actually growing me in any good quality direction.
 Having conversations that are just complaining about people.
 All of those things are choices that I'm actively making right now to not grow myself.
 Wow.
 So if you pull all of that time up, what do we do?
 We always complain about how many hours I work at work.
 And then we don't recognize that if it's eight hours at work, what do we do with the rest of the day?
 Right? Chances are you're up another eight hours doing something. What is that time filled with?
 If it's not filled with growing, you are doing something while better discipline than what is it being filled with.
 So you have to, once again, I'll point back to my youth where I was a people-pleaser.
 So I was living in that living.
 I spent a lot of time in that reward desire. If I can make people happy, then I'll be a good person.
 If I can, you know, a lot of times I was the problem for somebody else, even though I had absolutely nothing to do with their thing.
 I'm just the one that got blind for it in the process.
 So for me, I'm always trying to figure out how to fix, how do I solve, how do I duck?
 You know, all different types of stuff.
 Well, when, if instead, I was spending time on the better decision making side of, well, that's not where my worth is.
 What could my life, how could my life look better? What do I keep allowing people to talk to me this way?
 Treat me this way. Why do I keep putting myself in situations like this?
 Wow, I'm not actually a victim to this situation. I've allowed this to happen.
 If I would have spent more time there, then I would have grown faster earlier.
 So that's what I'm saying. Absolutely.
 So when you look at the opportunities you have every single day, I guarantee you, you can find an hour right now in every single day that you have to grow you.
 Yeah.
 Even if it's the discipline of controlling your thoughts, the discipline of controlling the negative self-talk, the discipline of controlling the lives.
 But if you don't put the tool in place, then it's not going to work.
 So if you want a better version of you, two things I feel like you have to do, you have to recognize the thing that's holding you back,
 and then you have to ask yourself this question, am I willing to get out of the desire reward part of my brain and move into that better decision making area?
 If I'm stuck in the desire reward self-control goes out the window, well power goes out the window, better decision making is gone.
 If I can stop focusing on the desire and reward area of my brain, what is this going to get me? How can I win this conversation?
 Ooh, I need to control this person. I need to control this situation.
 If I can get out of that, then I can make better decisions.
 So when I see and we'll talk about this in the other episode, somebody who's struggling with control.
 Instead of me getting emotionally handcuffed to it, I can back up, watch it.
 Like a movie knows exactly what's going to happen, and then make better decisions like I don't want to be a part of this.
 Yeah. I'm going to step up. We have a choice.
 We have a choice. Well, I love, and I think we can wrap up on this one thing that you said just to tease that back out.
 You know, we have, if we factor in eight hours of sleep, eight hours in the office, we have another eight.
 Yeah. We have eight hours. You know, you get up before you go to work.
 All that time is yours. It's all personal time. And, you know, just by that quote that started this whole conversation
 off today, how much time do we waste either in fruitless endeavors that don't really give rest that don't really replenish that, you know,
 don't feed back into our emotional pool and well-being. And instead, we're spending those energies on things that just ultimately bring more frustration and more negativity into our lives.
 So I think this is super, super helpful today. If we'll employ what we're talking about these tools to address those things in our minds and redirect that energy into transformation.
 How much farther down the road can we be by this time next year?
 Yeah. What is your walk look like this evening? What's the, what's the conversation in your head this evening?
 Yeah. What's the change? And again, I'm not saying ghosts spend the other eight hours gaining a master's degree on this, but choose a percentage of it.
 Have fun, go live life, but choose, you know, everything you say, yes, to you saying notice something.
 And then your quality of life goes up. I mean, I've wasted so many of those 30 minute walks in nature and it was so beautiful out, but because of what was going on internally, I get enjoy it.
 We're not wrapping up yet.
 Oh, we're so going.
 I just problem with those rambling.
 No.
 So here's a deal.
 Merried people.
 Think of how many times you have thought to be right in your marriage. Think of the hours you've spent arguing over being right.
 Think about the hours you've spent arguing over not being wrong.
 Think about how much time you've wasted, right?
 There's an amazing thing I love my wife to death. She's the most amazing person.
 Is she right all the time? No. Am I right all the time? No.
 Do we have opportunities to struggle all the time?
 But there's an amazing thing that happens when you utilize these tools. I care more about loving my wife than I do being in a fight.
 I care more about loving my wife than spending time not connected to her because we're instead of being one and being unified,
 where, you know, in opposite ends of the spectrum right now because we're upset at each other.
 So how do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you
 And again, you have a decision. Yeah, but I'm right.
 Okay. Well, then just stay in conflict with your spouse.
 Yeah, but I'm right. Well, fine. Then stay there, right? Or screw this.
 I'm going to, I'm going to fix this. I'm going to grab her hand. I'm going to hold her.
 I'm going to kiss on the cheek. I'm going to tell her I'm sorry for my part of this.
 And then I'm going to move forward.
 I'm not going to sit there and wait for her to go.
 Well, I'm sorry to. Well, I was wrong. You know, I'm not waiting for that. Why?
 Reconciling is right. It's just right. Here's a deal. I just turned 51 years old.
 I don't have time to waste. I want to enjoy love. I want to enjoy being connected. I want to enjoy joy.
 You know, I want to have those things in my marriage that waiting around and arguing and fighting is just not going to solve.
 So the sooner you can put these tools in place. And again, if you've not been through next level like you've got to get all the tools.
 Get all of it because it changes your marriage. It changes your family tree. It changes your relationships, right?
 The sooner I plug the tool in place, I'm happy.
 You know, I'm experiencing joy in my wife's happy. Our relationship is strong. It grows incredibly well. All of that stuff, which is a way better investment than spending time wanting,
 and just by sharing the reward I tell myself I will get by being right there. Now let's wrap it up. Now it's good.
 We can say we can take a lot of flowers, but yeah, so how about you closing this thing up?
 Well, I hope this has helped you, folks. Take this information, change your leadership, change your business, and change your life. And we'll see you next time on the Crystal Cutter Show.
