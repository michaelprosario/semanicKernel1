 Well folks welcome to the show John Lee Demos John welcome back brother good to have you back on Chris
 We don't make it to hang out with you my average goes up because you're the average of the five people
 He's the most time with the brothers so thank you for improving my average well I appreciate that I appreciate that
 That's it's the least I could do right there
 You know live just by being alive
 Well man, it's always good to have you on you. He's bring such great information and I listeners love having you on
 So let's just jump in you've got a new book out work cited about this here's what I want to know
 Why did you write it and who is it for?
 Man listen I've now interviewed Chris over three thousand of the world's most successful entrepreneurs
 I love it. It's been a decade and I've had amazing conversations with all these entrepreneurs
 Of course yourself being one of those geniuses. I got to interview and I have learned a ton over this process
 And my audience has learned a lot as well. There's been over a hundred million listens of this podcast on premiere going fire
 We're getting over 1.4 million monthly listens
 We've grown a fantastic audience, which I love and we refer to as fire nation and Chris
 I know you get this because you have a great audience as well
 You essentially get about the same ten questions from your audience. You know they're they're different
 very slightly, but they're the same ten questions in a sense and I get those by the hundreds of thousands like every day
 Week and month and I honestly love my audience. I want to answer these questions individually
 But there's no time of the world to do that
 So I said I need to sit down for once and for all and not pull out of my head like this
 There's a little you know army officers P-brain and this and this head right here
 I need to pull from the three thousand plus successful entrepreneurs
 If I've interviewed over the past decade the Chris is the Tony's the Tim Ferriss is the Gary vanachicks of the world
 I need to take their genius sit down
 synthesize it into one book one step by step road map and really identify what that was gonna look like and you know
 I sat down brother. I said well like what is Chris and Tony and Barbara Corkran and Sally Hawks
 I like all these fantastic entrepreneurs like what do they have in common?
 Then I was able to identify
 17 core foundational principles that you have brother that all of the successful entrepreneurs share with
 one another and I put those 17 core foundational principles into a chronological road map step by step step one
 to step 17 and I call the book the common path to uncommiss success
 It is a 17 step road map to find answer freedom and fulfillment
 It is the answer to my audiences problems and I'm gifting it to them
 I love it. It's such a good book and there's so much great information and I think one of the things like you just pointed out
 There's a lot of commonality and people who have been successful
 It's like people are looking to say
 Maybe there's one person who has all the right answers and believe it or not
 When you discover the information that you've put in the book you see that this is something that's made multiple people
 Successful. It's not like there's a magic pill that only one person on the planet has
 There's a lot of people that have experienced a lot of different things. It's just getting the right information
 and one of these we've talked about a period of struggling your life when this quote hits you pretty hard
 Try not to become a person of success
 But rather try to become a person of value and that was Einstein so that's a crazy powerful statement
 Why did it hit you so hard and what changes did you make?
 God you always pick out just like right the heart of the matter you always seem to do that
 So listen real quick back drop to that is you know
 I was option the US Army for eight years. I spent four years as an active duty officer and 13 months in
 I appreciate that thank you and I was a tank commander in charge of four tanks 16 men in Iraq during a time of war
 And that was a pretty intense time for me and that 26 years old
 I entered the world like ready to conquer the world. I was like if I could do that like being war
 I can do anything and Chris I went on to have six years of struggle six years of failure
 struggle depression PTSD everything mixed up into one nothing was working for me nothing for six years
 And then finally you know at the towards the end of those six years
 I did say I need to start reading books and you start listening to audio books and you just start listening to the right podcasts
 If I can find them and that led me to that quote you just mentioned which is by Albert Einstein
 Which is
 Try not to become a person of success, but rather a person of value and Chris I had to be honest with myself and say
 What is Albert talking about?
 I thought the only point in this world was the chase success was to become successful like
 That's what I thought the whole point of existence was and that quote I couldn't comprehend it
 You know I'm saying like I it wasn't processing so I just sit with that quote for a couple of days and like try to like decipher it
 I'm like I know this is English, but I don't get these words
 But then it finally did click for me and I said you know what here's Albert saying don't chase success
 But instead be a person of value and I looked in the mirror and I said dude
 What are you doing this being valuable like what have you done the past year this been of value to other people?
 And the answer was nothing and I said I get it. I get what Albert saying
 Of course I haven't been finding success because I'm not being a value to the world and that's what the world
 And ages people being of value and so that's what I committed in that moment Chris
 I said I am going to become a person of value
 I don't know what that's gonna look like but a planted a seed that three months later bloomed into my idea
 To launch the first daily podcast interviewing entrepreneurs and brother I was bad
 I was a bad podcast
 So bad interview where I was bad all of the things but I was committed to being the best daily podcast interviewing entrepreneurs
 And guess what I was because I was the only daily podcast interviewing entrepreneurs and now you and I are talking 10 years later
 3000 episodes a hundred million listeners 1.4 million monthly listens are business
 thriving 91 months in a row of a hundred thousand dollars net profit or more
 Life is good
 Now life is good you've done such an incredible job and I love the fact that a you're you're pointing people to
 Understanding the value is way more important than chasing after this ideal that really it doesn't exist in the numbers
 You know you can go after and go after and you might make it but you're never gonna find yourself going man
 I feel amazing about myself
 You're always gonna chase what's the new number what's the new one what's the new one when you can be a value that an incredible thing happens
 You just mentioned a phenomenal number 91 months 91 months
 I believe you just said of a hundred thousand net profit plus
 Because people are buying the value they're paying for the value
 It's that value that's getting you to that number which is so powerful since you
 Since entrepreneurs on fire launched you ask yourself how can I add more value?
 You said looking back on entrepreneurs on fire was a success because it provided the best solution to a real problem
 So you're looking at this
 solution of problem plus solution is getting to the value talk about that and what does that mean to the listeners and what does that mean to the people who are trying to run their businesses and
 You know are just trying to lead a team. What does that look like?
 So I want to step back from that specific question a little bit and I want to just share what what is the overall concept of this book
 What really is the overall concept that I've found that has been the reason for the success of the 3000 plus people that I've interviewed
 That is a direct response to the question you just asked which is
 You need to become the best solution to a real problem
 If you can look in the mirror and say in your eyes
 I am the best solution to this real specific problem in the world
 You will win Chris is the people that are just out there that are pale weak
 Immitations of other successful entrepreneurs that you see launching every day whether it be a podcast or a business or a product or a service or whatever it might be
 This world does not need pale weak imitations of successful people what this world needs is you
 Identifying your big idea your unique special
 unique snowflake in this world. There's nobody like you
 Inside within you if you take time to be a little introspective you can uncover and identify your big idea
 And you can say what is the zone of fire that I want to live within every single day and from that
 We can get to okay
 This is my zone of fire. What is the problem within this zone of fire that I've identified that I can become the best solution to
 Because if you can become the best solution to a real problem people will be to path to your door because everybody will most the best solution
 The number one solution to their problem the number two solution Chris they'll ignore you
 They'll ignore it all the way to infinity you want the best solution to a real problem
 So kind of rewinding what I shared a little bit earlier
 Watchman is on fire the day I launched I was the best solution to a real problem. What was this problem?
 There was no daily podcast interviewing entrepreneurs everyone was once per week
 I as a consumer and listener podcast wanted a daily podcast. It didn't exist
 So I launched it I became the best that was also the worst don't tell anybody but I would only
 Daily podcast so I was the best solution to a real problem in the world and people beat a path to my doorstep
 To the tune of now over a hundred million listens over the past decade and that's the synthesis of this book
 B-a
 B-not a b-the
 best solution to a real problem
 Absolutely now lots of folks have big ideas and like you've put it out a lot of folks have come after trying to
 Recreate somebody else's big idea which rarely works out very well
 It it always ends up kind of sucking but a lot of folks have some really big ideas and
 You say that's not enough. It's not enough to just have a big idea
 You talk about reaching a zone of fire. You've already mentioned that explain that and tell us what most people are missing
 So listen identifying your big idea unbelievably important. We just talked briefly about it
 Chris is barred up again. It is step one in this book. It is chapter one in the column path known calm success
 But there's a reason there's 17 steps because if it was just coming up with your big idea
 Like hello everybody be successful and then who knows what the world would be like like a dispute where place
 Now there's 17 steps in this process. So your big idea
 I want to be very truthful with your audience Chris and I mean this genuinely your big idea is a great idea
 I really mean that is going to be a great idea period
 But other people have had that great fantastic idea as well and if you just wander into the competition
 Meadow like a little lamb you will get slaughtered by the entrenched competition now by the way
 It's good that there's competition that there are people doing your big idea right now because that's validation
 That's proof of concept. That's a big idea. This is real and
 You instead of just saying I'm going to wander into this meadow like a little lamb getting ready to be slaughtered
 You and said me to say okay, well, I want to be getting up my journey. You know
 I'm still a little baby lamb here. What I need to do is move on to step two
 Which is discover your niche?
 Identify the void that's not being filled within your big idea
 What is a problem that's not being solved within your big idea that you can be the best solution to because you'll be the only solution to it
 So let's go to you a fire for an example is my idea was a podcast
 Okay, I would have gotten slaughtered just launching a podcast so I niche down and to a business podcast
 Okay, there's 300 business podcasts. I mean Chris is in others would have destroyed me because I was a new podcast
 So I niche down the third time business podcasts interviewing entrepreneurs. Okay, there's seven of those
 Do I want to be the eighth best podcast interviewing entrepreneurs?
 No nobody wants the eighth best
 So I said what are these podcasts doing wrong or what are they missing or what's something that I complained about with these podcasts
 And it goes back to what we talked about which is nobody's doing a seven day
 We podcast and I wish that it existed because I was even time my friends like man
 I just was in a great episode, but the next episode is not coming live for another week
 I can wait seven more days and I was like what am I complaining about why not be the change?
 You want to see in the world to quote Gandhi and again that led me to niche down a fourth time until it hurts
 Discover a niche a void that this not being filled in day one become the best solution to a real problem
 And I think this is it's such a powerful piece if you've ever done this, but there's a lot of
 Fear that is built around this concept of niching down
 I mean I remember in my early days when I first came up with upon this concept of hey man
 You you can't touch everybody you can't help everybody you know
 So let's take a look at a hard look at where you're really good at and where you can you can niche down and help this and I remember in those early days
 Thinking oh, I'm gonna be giving up a bunch
 You know, there's there I'm letting I'm gonna be leaving on a bunch on the table and that's absolutely false you talk about
 Identifying and underserved niche
 So what is the pushback that you get what is the the experience that you have as your telling entrepreneurs
 Push into this area what are the things that you see that are struggles from other people about narrowing down that audience
 But John I'm not gonna have enough clients or customers or people to buy my stuff like this would be too small of a niche too small
 You know of a marketplace and I say it's exactly the opposite and what I want to you to visualize here
 Just like I had you visualize a lamb getting slaughtered earlier like I'm sure that was a great visualization people
 I want you to visualize right now a girl just screaming into the winds
 Guess what nobody can hear her nobody cares
 Because she's screaming into the winds and that's you trying to resonate with everybody you are screaming amidst the noise the chaos
 The busyness the insanity of this world and nobody's gonna care because you try to resonate with everybody
 You will resonate with nobody but when you become the best solution for a real problem in this world
 Then you have a chance to win then you have a chance to do that something that's so hard in this world
 Chris is like just taking your fingertips and just like just getting a little ledge there and just you know
 Wedging yourself in there with like you know a little just wedge and just slowly getting traction moment
 proof of concepts one follower 10 people that are fanatic why because you're the only person providing the best solution to their real problem
 And then it's 20 people and then before you know it my little tiny niche of the only podcast interviewing entrepreneurs on a seven-day
 We basis has become a media empire that is gross over two
 Sorry 20 million dollars in the past almost decade
 Almost all that net profit because we've done that with an incredibly lean small team
 Not to mention we live in Puerto Rico and we only pay 4% tax out
 The review that I talked about that years ago. It was just like man. This is a great idea
 Yeah, I told you back then I said do not move the Puerto Rico until you're ready to keep the money
 You make and apparently you're already
 It's so hot. I'm from to hell as you can see at the background here from the cold area
 It's unbelievably pleasant in humid both in the 90 every day
 They'll build up and I know you have that nice pool. I've seen that there
 I can say that like for us we we
 Knitched away the heck down and one of the things that's amazing for us is that we teach really difficult stuff
 It's not easy like we have a lot of clients come in it's painful. It's difficult and what are the things we point out is is that
 This is all we're gonna teach for a reason
 You know, there's not a lot of folks that can set at the table and deal with this heavy of stuff a lot of folks want it nice and easy and
 And then we're just not up for that so that not only did it give us a great core group of people that we could go after
 And teach and lead and guide
 But it also gave us the people who wanted it and I think that was one of the most powerful pieces
 For us was to take a look and see these are people who are not only wanting the great information
 But they're willing to go through the steps to get it and make it successful in their business and their leadership all that kind of fun stuff
 But you also talk about the proof of concept peace of niching down
 Which I think is is vital talk to that. Why is that so important?
 So again, I just said back a little bit because something you said earlier was so poignant and it's so true is that
 You essentially were just saying that
 You do what other people are both unwilling and unable to do
 Now when you can say that in this truth
 You've done the following you have built a barrier that is so high that your competition will be so loud
 And you need to do this in this world you need to build a high barrier because the higher the barrier
 the lower the competition
 What did I do with my podcast? I built such a high barrier doing a seven-day we podcast the people that didn't think was
 Logistically possible interviewing an entrepreneur seven days a week logistically a possible John
 The best people in the world told me that in the podcast in space and I
 Actually said wow if the best people in the podcast in space to tell me it can't be done and I find a way to do it
 Think of opportunity there
 So I built a barrier so high by doing something the other people worked willing or able to do
 I didn't just have a low competition. I had no competition and
 The lower and the lower the barrier that you build
 The more competition you're gonna have because you're easily replicated and that's another huge
 mistake that so many people are doing in this world. Chris is they're saying oh my god
 I have a really good idea. I'm gonna do this and guess what it really is a good idea
 But there's a huge flawed problem with it. It's easily replicated so as soon as they have success in this really good idea
 The hoard piles in because everybody wants to copy success and hoard piles in and then everybody loses
 You know there's a reason they say marketers ruin everything because marketers ruin everything and it's your fault
 Because you built a low barrier and so when there's a low barrier
 There's gonna be high competition because people can just walk over and step over to barrier
 I built a wall like Constantinople like there was no breaking that wall same with Chris like people aren't and can't do what Chris does
 They can't do it and so he is
 The solution to his clients problems
 I was the only solution to my client problems. I built a moat around this podcast right here
 Archmores on fire just like Chris is used the late Tahoe right behind him to help him build his moat around his business
 And that's the key and you know to kind of like end this point on what you were asking as far as proof of concept
 That's going back to the hardest thing you're going to really achieve and this
 You're going to get to in this world's an entrepreneur is
 Momentum is traction is proof of concepts. It's like looking at that
 You know 1,000 year bolder at the top of a hill this means stuck there forever. That's you at the beginning of your journey
 You can push that thing all that you you can and you want to and that's not moving an inch
 But when you do a few things right you use some leverage
 You use you know some things that we talk about of course here on this episode today and in the book
 Like you find a way to just
 Crack you know that rock a little bit and you start to push it down the hill and like slowly
 It serves to turn and then what happens before you know it's this nothing
 Nothing can stop this bullder just cascading down the hill and that's part of this first mooper advantage
 So you know for me like I've you know bushing my butt like marketing my podcast and doing all things
 I can't watch moves on fire, but think of all of the moments in those happening from other people as well
 People in in the when I was not in the room people talking about my income reports
 How crazy I was my daily podcast the fact that is in a view Tony Robbins the other way wherever it was like
 They were helping me build this momentum up even when I wasn't there and so it's like that's how difficult is to get momentum as an entrepreneur
 But when you get it's
 Hang on for the ride because sometimes you're just wow you're like how did I go from X?
 You know to why just like that because of that momentum
 Yeah, I know you've you've seen it obviously I've seen it where people have tried to replicate what you've done and
 None of them are out
 What you know you see you see them try go to after it and it's like
 It's just not gonna happen all right, so leading into others
 Leading into others what mentors and coaches bring to the table that is coming up right out to this
 Hey, it's Joel Fortner here. I'm device president a leadership development on Chris's team
 And I oversee our next level mastermind business coaching program
 Most business owners and leaders lack of clear path to succeed in business
 The question whether they're making the right decisions if they're focusing on the right things to really grow their business
 If this is you you need a coach in your life
 Coaches help you make better decisions navigate uncertainty
 Lead more effectively and grow your business without sacrificing your life in your family
 In their first year our clients typically see an average of 67% increase in gross revenue and an average of
 138% increase in net profit and regain hours of time our clients stay in the program for we're three and a half years
 Simply because of the results they get
 So if you're ready to run your business at the next level and see the growth you've been wanting and visit
 Chris the curto dot com slash mastermind again
 Chris the curto dot com slash mastermind today
 You
 All right, we're back with John Lee Dumis and
 We're hitting another principle in the book and this is something that we talk a lot about around here and that is finding a mentor in a coach
 Your perfect mentor is currently where you want to be one year from today
 Such a powerful piece sometimes people resist this idea
 What's some of the pushback that you get and why?
 But John, but I want Richard Branson to be my mentor. I want more human to be my mentor and I'm like
 Hey, they don't mentor people
 But be like you couldn't afford them if they did and see like there would be terrible mentors for you and they really
 What they because listen your mentor is somebody who is currently where you want to be
 About one year from now like that
 In can be one year from now like that is where you're gonna find your mentor because that person
 hasn't just done and taken the path that you're about to embark upon
 But they've done it recently, so that means they have a relevance knowledge relevant information like
 Listen if I don't watch another podcast for the next 50 years
 I'm not gonna be teaching people in 50 years how to launch a podcast because I won't even know everything's changed
 So I'm not relevant to people launching their podcast if I haven't launched one I mean for myself
 I usually launch a podcast every every year or two just because that's what I do
 I enjoy it and plus I run the biggest podcast in community in the world
 podcast was paradise so I insist that I stay a relevance and I keep my finger on the pulse on all of those things
 But the point is your perfect mentor is somebody who's currently where you want to be a year from now
 And so my mentor was a successful business podcast host that had just launched your podcast 16 months prior and so I said Jamie
 You've launched a podcast you've grown it in 16 months
 You know around that year mark to a successful business podcast guess what I want to launch in grow a successful business
 Podcast can you mentor me will you mentor me how do I pay who do I pay where do I pay and
 I invest in myself I hired the right mentor and it changed everything because now I had somebody who had been down the path
 That I was at Bell toon bark upon she could help me avoid the pot holes and the rabbit holes in the mistakes and
 Folks on what actually mattered my network grew exponentially just by hiring her because now I went to a conference with her
 She's introducing me to all of her friends which are the path flans the Amy port of fields
 You know the Michael highest of the world and I'm like oh wow like that was a lot easier than like you know
 Not having somebody who was friends of those people introduced me and like here I am so it was an absolute game
 Changer it's available to anybody if you go about in the right man. Yeah, I think it's it's
 Surprises people like one of the things you know that's we do so much coaching and so much teaching and so much mentoring
 But when people find out I've got mentors I've got coaches
 You know if I'm gonna go after something if I'm gonna put my time into something I don't go try and figure it out
 I did that when I was younger you know I remember being the the young guy who would you know
 Buy a bicycle and instead of reading the instruction manual. I got this. I'm gonna figure this out
 You you feel the pain enough and you start going
 Maybe I should actually get some good instructions on this when you start putting a quality mentor or coach in your life
 It changes the way you go about stuff and so it's just crazy powerful
 So the book is the common path to the uncommon success such a powerful book one last question
 If you're good to go back to a young John Lee Demis what is something you would tell him?
 What thing I would honestly tell that young John Demis is chill out like just for laughs because
 It seems like we're always like on this
 Presibus of like disaster like you're 21 you're like oh my god my life is starting
 I'm gonna do everything right now. Oh my god on 25
 Getting old like in some 30 30 like whatever age you are you just think that like now's the time
 I've got to be this come this great success and you put so much pressure on yourself and that just leads you to make mistakes
 Like mistakes and I name which is like I guess I got to do something real
 So I'm gonna go to law school which was a huge mistake. Okay. I guess I need to respectful jobs
 I'm gonna go into corporate finance like huge mistake
 If I just sat down chill that I've been like you know what you're okay JLD like you're okay
 Guess what money in the bank? You don't know what you want to do like let's just take a one step at a time
 Let's figure it out. You know honestly like obviously like
 You know selfish plug, but I mean like if I had a book like this when I was 20 years old
 I mean
 No, it was what would have happened. You know I mean it's just like I just I had to do this learn this the hard way
 The painful way I wasn't I didn't become an entrepreneur so it was 32 years old
 That's when I talked to like 23 or old and there's like John like man
 I just feel like like I'm so far behind you. I'm like
 You're starting at 20 or 23 or 30. I didn't even start my journey close 32
 Like how can you even think that you're behind me? It's like you're eight years ahead of me just by even knowing what the word entrepreneur means
 So I would tell that person to chill out
 I love it man
