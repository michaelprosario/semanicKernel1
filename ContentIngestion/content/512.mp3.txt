 What happens when toxicity holds people back or were yet?
 They start to poison and affect others negatively?
 That is coming up next.
 Welcome to the Crystal Cardo Show, where we discuss leadership and life
 and discover that business is what you do, not who you are.
 Welcome to the show, folks.
 I hope you're having a fabulous day wherever you are.
 I hope it's really fabulous, especially with today's topic toxicity.
 Hey, let's talk about toxic people.
 I know that that is something you are super excited to get to right now.
 Some of you probably are.
 This is a very important topic in many lives.
 If it's not something that you are experiencing or don't feel like you've experienced,
 then it's great to understand this and know this.
 But on the the back side of this or by the end of this,
 the goal is to have a greater understanding of what we see with toxicity.
 We're going to talk about a lot of things that we experience and things that we have learned over the decades.
 Joining me today from Brighton Sunny, Sicily,
 actually I have no clue what the weather is like, is Brian Alex, welcome to the show, Brian.
 Thank you.
 We get little bit of about sunshine and I just try to soak it up.
 That's your five minutes of vitamin D.
 So Brian's going to be joining me and kind of just walking through an interviewing me on aspects of what we have learned and what we've experienced and things to just help us to understand toxicity better.
 But before we get into all of that and by the way, we've all had our fair share of toxicity of being toxic, right?
 You know, there's no doubt.
 We always say that the stuff that we teach here is stuff that we have screwed up in our lives.
 I have screwed up mistakes that I've made.
 Praise God, he's taught us how to fix a bunch of stuff.
 How to get healthier, how to do things differently.
 And being a teacher, my goal is to not just sit on that stuff and make myself better.
 But it's to change as many lodges as I possibly can.
 And praise God, I have a group of people that are battling that battle with me to help people get it is healthy as they possibly can.
 So with that, we're going to talk about a bunch of things that we've learned and experienced.
 But before we get deep into the toxicity, I want to deal with what we know to be the elephant in the room.
 You may not know this.
 A lot of people may not know this, but it's something that we see as being the big focus of why there's so much toxicity.
 Can you guess what it is?
 Are you thinking how many people out there answering what it is right now in your head, right?
 The thing is fear.
 Fear tends to be such an underlying piece of what we experience in toxicity.
 Now, you know, it's probably not your past wounds in trauma.
 It's probably not your environment as much as you'd like to think it is.
 It's probably not other people that are holding you back in your own life.
 Nope.
 Guess what it is.
 It's you.
 So whether you're being toxic or not.
 Whether you are.
 Have a tendency to be toxic or not.
 One of the things that we discover over and over and over again is that fear holds people back.
 So just to kind of give you an example.
 One of the things we talk about in strap and with all the leadership stuff is that when you're focused on you,
 when you are being self centered, when you're being self focused, like let's say you're being defensive.
 Let's say you're being self protective.
 There's an important thing to understand.
 Quality perspective gathering comes to a screeching halt.
 So what am I saying?
 You can't gain quality perspective.
 You can't ask good questions.
 You can't seek.
 You can't be curious.
 One you're totally focused on you.
 Now, some of you that might land really well and you get that and you're like, yeah, that totally makes sense.
 And some people like, no, I think I still can't.
 You can't.
 I'm sorry.
 You just can't.
 Why?
 Because what is your focus?
 I'm protecting me right now, which means that I can't be curious to understand your side of the situation.
 I can't be someone who is wanting to really understand this thing that we're discussing, this topic, whatever.
 So it's important for us to understand that if I am in fear mode, I'm afraid of losing worth.
 I'm afraid of losing identity.
 I'm afraid of having to take responsibility for something which I've convinced myself.
 I'm going to lose power in the situation.
 I'm going to give power to somebody else.
 Whatever this thing is, that fear holds me back.
 Right?
 That fear holds you back.
 This is incredibly important to understand as we go through this.
 Because when you're living in this fear and let me just give this caveat, again, you've heard me say this a thousand times, there's two types of fear.
 There is the eminent fear, this is literally happening, you're being chased by a line.
 Right?
 Something is going to happen.
 That's a legitimate fear.
 You can see it.
 It's going to happen.
 98% of fear is imagined.
 It's the stuff that I imagine might could possibly maybe happen.
 And what we see when it comes to toxicity is behind so much toxicity.
 So much people's wounds, so much of people's trauma.
 I really hate to use the word trauma because that's become a throwaway word nowadays where, you know, if you almost drop your coffee, it was traumatic, that's just ridiculous.
 But whatever people are experiencing, so much of what's behind it is fear.
 So let's just get this out in the open.
 A lot of people are held captive to and tormented by, yes, I did just say tormented.
 And some of you, especially my highest is out there.
 My highest is out there.
 You are probably folks that might be tormenting yourself to this and high eyes as well.
 A lot of people are held captive to and tormented by fear.
 So two things that I want to point out before we get into this toxicity issue.
 Number one, fear is often a product.
 An outlet or a manifestation of self-deception.
 What we're talking about, Chris, well, a great definition is self-deception is when you deny irrationalized relevant,
 significant or important evidence and logical argument.
 It's living in a fictitious reality, a fantasy lies.
 And when you're believing lies, then you're deceiving yourself and you're afraid.
 So think about how many things that we see in our lives, how many things we see in politics and what's happening in the nation,
 and whatever, pick whatever it is. When we choose to deny facts, when we choose to deny relevant information,
 when we choose to deny important evidence because of fear, then we're self-deceiving.
 I almost said we are self-deceiving ourselves. Very redundant. The department of the redundancy department right there.
 When we are removing these things, denying these things, then we are deceiving us.
 Another term for this and you've heard me say this before.
 Many times, if we are getting input on ideology, could be what's called ideological subversion.
 We hear a lie so long, so hard that eventually it becomes truth, and we deny facts.
 We deny significant information.
 Either way, whether it's stuff that we're telling ourselves, whether it's a lie that we're believing from somebody else, it's deception.
 And a big piece of the self-deception is the fear factor. Instead of me digging in and spending time gaining quality perspective,
 instead of me digging in finding out being curious to get to true facts, I allow the fear to make it true.
 So that's the first thing. Number two, fear forces you to focus on self-protection, self-preservation.
 It's this kind of situation, a posture that all kinds of toxins build up inside of us.
 We believe the lies. We're afraid we take a defensive posture.
 We go into specific patterns like self-deception, self-protection, self-sabotage, even self-harmon.
 We have literally seen self-flagulation from people. They physically harden themselves because of the lies that they're believing.
 And so many of those lies are lies that they tell themselves. Folks, it's a terrible situation. It's a heartbreaking situation.
 To watch people who live in fear, who live in lies, consistently deceive and even mentally, emotionally and physically arm themselves.
 All kinds of toxic behavior crop up from where a root system that's in bondage to fear.
 What are some of those behaviors we see? Anger is quite often one.
 And you see a lot of this nowadays, right? We see a lot of people just being angry in life.
 We see a ton of offense. Now, I'm going to say a lot of that is coming from your root system.
 And I think a ton of it is coming from the influences in your life.
 We've talked about this. We've got great shows where we've discussed even with teenagers and kids and the influence that's happening to them.
 But us as adults. If you're spending your day watching the news, guess what? You're going to be offended by a lot of things.
 Right? If you're spending your day on social media, where people are complaining about everything. Not too long ago, just I think a couple episodes ago, I talked about our youngest daughter.
 Kelly, who I'm so proud of, that she was in this social group. It was supposed to be this fun group. I wanted to create things I love about Kelly. She loves cards.
 Right? And yet it turns she goes, oh my gosh, there's so much drama in this group. It went from, hey, we could talk about cool cars to now, you know, people are just becoming total idiots. And so she's like, I am so done with this. I can't do this. I wanted this to be a fun group. It's not I'm out.
 I've been let them know. This has become a group of drama. I'm out. And I was so proud of her to see her stand for that. Right? But it's not uncommon to see that happening everywhere.
 Another toxic behavior is outpers. We see so many people nowadays being so out of control personally, that their responses are just over the top.
 And one of the things that I have a tendency to ask somebody who's struggling with outbursts. And I will ask myself, if I'm struggling with, you know, responses is, is this response equal to the situation.
 How many times do we see people losing their minds over essentially nothing, right? Other bad behaviors, defensiveness and probably one of the, one of the worst poor decision making.
 And I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm
 She also taught that last year at the next level of leadership live event and it just blew people away. Blue people away. Today, however, we've also got Brian back in the studio or in the studio and Sicily. Let me say that.
 And we're going to get into all of this stuff when we come back. So when we come back, what is toxicity? Where does it come from? And what does it look like when it's present?
 Freedom, it's so powerful. I don't rejuvenate and almost renewed. I just felt so welcomed and loved and accepted for who I am and not an ounce of judgment. So I was very comfortable there.
 That had a really big impact on me. It's going to be worth it. It's going to be hard for us to be even better on the other side.
 For me, it was just very refreshing. And I want to say life giving for me really was. You know, I would go to the next level of life again and probably again and probably again because it's so powerful.
 If you want to experience the same kind of life transformation, the same kind of self-awareness and freedom that they have or maybe you're just curious what the process would look like for you, then head on over to crsacrido.com/nextlevellife.
 All right, we are back and Brian Alex are Sicilian, which I say on it.
 I don't know.
 Are scully.
 So fantastic.
 Oh, no.
 It's incredible. We could say our man on the street consistently, but we don't have any of those interviews. That would be fun. You should just go outside.
 But we could understand it.
 All right. So Brian is joining me.
 And we are going to be talking through a bunch of stuff that we have learned and experienced so Brian, let me turn this over to you to get us rolling.
 And I love what you were talking about there and the the underlying fear factor in all of this. It's a little absurd, but it made me think of Star Wars.
 There's a part where Yoda is talking about how fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate,
 and it's suffering.
 He says at the end.
 But no, I mean, there's some truth in that where fear is kind of this underpin of our anger, the things that are going on, the toxicity that we have building up inside of us.
 And I love that we're tackling this.
 It is a torment.
 People are tormented by fear a lot of times, and it is suffering.
 And I'm glad that we're finally digging into this. We've got some episodes, fun episodes coming up this year about health, physical health, mental health, psychological health, how to stay healthy and a toxic culture.
 But we're dealing with the toxicity that's in us first. And I think that's appropriate.
 Just for some perspective, I've been reading some books and I came across this quote by a physician, Gabor Maté and he's talking about living in a toxic culture.
 And he says this, in the most health obsessed society ever talking about today, all is not well.
 Health and wellness have become a modern fixation.
 And yet, here it is. Our collective health is deteriorating.
 And so yeah, I want to tease out some things about what you're seeing because we've been ten years now in this.
 Your leadership goes back decades.
 But next level life we've been doing for ten years over 500 of these leading people through to, you know, through a process to health, to find freedom, all of that.
 And I want to tease out some of what you're seeing.
 But just on on the, you know, I guess the basics here of what is, what does it mean to be toxic?
 What is it? What are we talking about a toxic culture?
 And toxins are just basically poison. There are things that kill and destroy health. It's anti life and health and flourishing and all of that.
 I mean, it's like getting a wound in our soul in our mind and our emotions that gets infected and just won't go away until it's cleaned out, disinfected,
 and that toxicity is what we're talking about. That inner infection. And so I'd love to hear some things from you, Chris, about where you're coming from.
 You mentioned in the intro that you've, you've grown up around some toxic people and in toxic environments.
 What is that look like? I mean, you mentioned some of these surface level responses, but is there a picture that you could paint?
 To just talk about, you know, people who are psychologically or emotionally toxic, they're poisoning themselves and others.
 What did that look like for you that brought you to the place of really putting a stop to it and then saying, gosh, I'm going to help other people get this toxicity out of them.
 So I think what's important is to really, you know, I could spend an hour giving examples of what toxicity looks like.
 But I think hitting the highlights of what people I think will relate to the easiest, I think it's probably the best idea on this.
 So I'm just going to throw a few things out there. One of the things I usually tend to say is, if there is self sabotage, right? If I am doing things to hurt myself,
 that's toxicity. So if you think about it, what does it, you know, I love that you've used the example of a toxin, right?
 As somebody who has been spending years trying to get lead out of my body, which everybody asks that I, you know, the Tommy Boy thing, did you look paint chips?
 No, I think I had spent a few years in a house that had lead pipes.
 But it has been a incredible process to try and get this stuff out. A painful process, difficult exhausting, very difficult on the health side, which is why we focus so much on helping people on the physical health side as well.
 Those toxins have been having it ericine havoc inside of my body. It has been affecting my blood pressure.
 It's been affecting me not being able to lose weight, which praise God have been able to find some ways around that. It's been affecting me and my energy, how I process my stomach. All these different things, this one toxin inside of my body has been wreaking havoc.
 Now let's translate that to fear. Let's translate that to self protection. Let's translate that to being worried about losing worth at a high level.
 When you have something that's affecting you so much that you go to hurting yourself, that's toxicity.
 Some of the things that people relate to. One of the things that I struggle with most because they've been heavily inundated in my life, one is guilt.
 I came out of a lot of guilt team. When people are struggling so heavily with whatever, fear of something, fear of losing worth, fear of losing control, fear of being not having power, fear of losing power, whatever it is, one of those responses tends to be guilt in other people.
 I think a lot of people can recognize that are maybe they've experienced that in their life.
 For me, I had multiple people in my life that I was there problem. I was the if something was wrong with them, I was the easy target.
 Very submissive person, very high S. Very easy to all of a sudden for somebody else to gain control was to attack me with guilty. Oh, you're the reason why this I wasn't even here. I didn't have anything to do with that. I don't know what you're talking about.
 But it was so pounded into me over and over and still 52.5. Well, yesterday was my 53rd birthday. So 53 years later, I still experienced that from people I know and love.
 Your my problem. It's because it doesn't matter what kind of and now that I've been healthier for decades and able to set healthy boundaries, it is something that makes it really difficult for people to do because it's very easy for me to see it.
 I made a sense of healthy boundaries. But for me for decades, the first half of my life, I was a dormant to people because I believed so much of the stuff that I was being told.
 I believed that I was the problem for so many people. So not only was somebody self sabotaging themselves with guilty because they were having to say, I'm so much more important than this other person.
 I'm willing to suggest that this person is terrible, bad, whatever. They were struggling with the toxicity that it didn't matter how they treated me.
 It didn't matter what they did to me. So I think that's something that a lot of people can relate to. So there's toxicity on both parts there.
 You have a person who's being toxic and suggesting toxicity to somebody else. You have somebody else who's receiving it. We say all the time, especially next level, I can't make you anything.
 I can't make you feel. I can't make you think. I can't make anything happen except if I physically overpower you. That's something I can physically control. If I can physically overpower you, that's something I can make you be out of control physically.
 I can't make you think anything. I can't make you believe anything. I can't make you fear something. All I can do and I want everybody to just really get this, all I can do is highly suggest that you do.
 So for so many years, it was highly suggested I was the problem. It was highly suggested that I'm responsible for somebody else's happiness.
 That I'm responsible for why they're not happy. All those suggestions were directed at me for so long and not just by one person by multiple people that I received it.
 It wasn't until I came to a boiling point in my early 20s and said enough is enough. I shut down. I'm a high altruist, I'm a high S. I shut down.
 I focused my time on God. I knew that I needed to and I spent a six year period of just going screw all of this. I need a better relationship with God. I need to understand this stuff.
 I really shifted my belief systems and I really shifted the research, the study, the counseling, everything, the things that I did to get this information to a place of going, that's what's going on.
 I think that a lot of people can relate to. Anger is a self-sabotized. If I am feeling so out of control that I start attacking with anger, that I have this heavy threat of anger, I just blow into anger out first.
 I think that's something that people can experience pretty quickly because usually, usually it's not always.
 There are times people have pushed me to the point that I have had to fire back with a hold on this is super unhealthy. This is done we're stopping this. That is completely different than anger, ripping somebody's head off, losing total control.
 That is a self-sabotized. Why? Because I am dumping just incredible amounts of toxicity into my body. My cortisol levels are shooting through the roof.
 I'm destroying certain things. I'm destroying melatonin. I'm destroying good quality hormones in my body. I'm just dumping tons of toxicity into my stomach.
 I think that's something that's many people have experience. The other side of self-sabotized I want to hit again is the part that I struggle with so much.
 I'm just about to be so toxic by receiving and believing and not doing something about it and not fixing it and not changing it and living in the fear of I am this horrible person.
 I'm allowing people. You and I have talked about this because we both experienced this in our lives of believing and having people earlier on in our lives that almost convinced us were crazy.
 This thing that we would push back on, "Hey, this is not what it is." It literally is not what it is. That doesn't exist. You're making that up.
 It's just this. My nuts. Only to have another outside source go, "You do see that." I thought I did, but I've been experienced that allowing somebody to have that type of influence itself to have a touch in itself.
 That person starts to say, "Well, maybe none of this is reality." They've been able to, "Somebody else has been able to set my reality and maybe I'm just wrong." Maybe I am not seeing this correctly.
 Maybe this isn't happening and only to discover that it is. I think those are things for people if you take a look at those types of self-sabotage. What's underlying? Why is their fear there?
 Most of the time, and again, we have to dig into the person's specific root system to discover why that fear exists, but many times that basic fear is, "I can't be out of control."
 You're not talking about this before. A lot of high seas don't relate to that phrase. "I am in control." How do you feel? "Frustrated." What's the difference?
 You're saying the word "control," and I don't think that I'm out of control. But you're responding very frustrated.
 Well, yes, that's the same kind of thing. It's a different definition of "verbage." When somebody can't be out of control, when somebody can't lose control, when somebody can't lose worth, when somebody can't lose identity, when that compounds to a point,
 it becomes super toxic. That's when we see these other responses. Gilting, shaming, ripping people's heads off, manipulation, highly suggesting that there's something wrong with the other person that things aren't happening.
 These things are built up because the person who's out of control is in such a high level of fear that they can't be out of control that it becomes.
 We say this a lot next level, I have a self-infilling prophecy.
 I can't be out of control because I'm unable. I don't have quality tools. I don't know what it's like to not have to struggle with that.
 When it gets close, I the self-infilling prophecy kicks and I've become out of control to the point that I self-sabathalize and I become toxic.
 Does all of that make sense? Questions on any of that?
 Yeah, that's so much there to flesh out. How many episodes would we need?
 I want to circle back around and just highlight one piece of that. If you are on the receiving end and you're not putting appropriate healthy boundaries, that is a form of self-sabathalize.
 You're sabotaging yourself and you're enabling the perpetuation of that cycle where you have a toxic person dumping on someone who's receiving it and that's toxicity too.
 You're going to get stuck there. It gets really close to this kind of co-dependent type situation where they're tethered together and they don't feel like either one. Don't feel like they can break free of that.
 And you're going to be able to do that.
 You're going to be able to do that.
 You're going to be able to do that.
