 Welcome to the Crystal Cardo Show, where we discuss leadership and life and discover that business is what you do not who you are.
 [Music]
 Welcome to the show folks. I hope you're having a fabulous new year so far, which it's...
 We're a couple days in, hopefully this year has started off better than the last one, hopefully you're doing well.
 We are doing great and I am super excited because joining me on the show today is my amazing and beautiful and incredible wife Heather.
 So welcome back to the show babe. It's good to have you on.
 It's good to be here.
 I would say we are... I'm joining the studio, but today we're actually not cutting in the studio.
 We are cutting up the ridge and so...
 We've got a pretty amazing view right now.
 We have a pretty spectacular view and you may actually hear from time to time some sounds of some animals about the background.
 A few guinea's in the background.
 Walking around.
 Yeah, making noises.
 So that's definitely a possibility, but we want to get into some relatively private things that we've been mentioning before our live events,
 but we've not really been able to give much detail on that before now.
 So we're going to kind of talk about that today, but really quickly before we dive into all of that.
 I want to remind you about the next level leadership live event that is coming up soon.
 So if you are a business owner or a leader, this event is designed for you.
 This is our premier once a year event and it's open to the public so you don't want to miss it.
 This year we have even more of what you love both the leadership sessions and life sessions.
 So right now we're in the extreme early bird phase where you can get 30% off of your tickets.
 It's easy to do.
 Just go to crissacardal.com/nextlevelleadership to reserve your seats today.
 Alright, now having said all of that, let's kind of dig into the story of the rich.
 Now before we do that, a lot of you have been with us for a very long time, but we have a lot of new folks coming on a continuous basis.
 So I just kind of wanted to share what we're called to do.
 Our point main is our corporate name.
 Obviously the brand is Chris LeCardo, but our corporate name is the point main group.
 And point main actually is a specific type of shepherd.
 It's a kind of shepherd that would love its flock.
 Heal its flock.
 Feed its flock.
 Leave the 99 for the one.
 It's the kind of shepherd that takes care of its flock.
 We feel we are called to help people understand and gain perspective and grow in ways that change their decision making.
 That change their relationships.
 That change how they lead people that change how they love on people.
 So those are the things that we feel that we are called to do.
 And God has continued to bless the business over the past eight years.
 Actually nine years.
 I mean in a few just a couple of weeks it's actually nine.
 We'll be celebrating nine years.
 Crazy to think that.
 How crazy is that?
 Good.
 And so I kind of wanted to just talk about the heart of a shepherd and how that factors into what we do.
 Now we do the work of a shepherd and like I shared that's what point main means.
 Our business is focused on creating an environment where people feel safe or people feel loved or they feel supported.
 Or they feel equipped or they feel nurtured so that they can get that life change that business change, that relationship change.
 So when we come back the process of how God came through as we took steps of faith into the next season of our lives, our work and the ministry that he's calling us to.
 Freedom.
 It's so powerful.
 I don't rejuvenate and almost renewed.
 I just felt so welcomed and loved and accepted for who I am and not an ounce of judgment.
 So I was very comfortable there.
 That had a really big impact on me.
 It's going to be worth it.
 It's going to be hard for us going to be even better on the other side.
 For me it was just a very refreshing and I want to say life giving to me and really was.
 I mean I would go to the next level of life again and probably again and probably again because it's so powerful.
 I want you to ask yourself a question, could you hear the sense of hope and freedom and their voices just then?
 I want you to know that could be you.
 Look, it's easy to get trapped in old habits, negative thought patterns and unhealthy relationships.
 It's going to take some work but yes, there is hope for you.
 If you want to experience the same kind of life transformation, this same kind of self-awareness and freedom that they have or maybe you're just curious what the process would look like for you, then head on over to Chrissacrido.com/nextlevellife.
 Before the break, I mentioned that our business is focused on creating an environment where people feel safe,
 loved, supported, equipped and nurtured. Well, not long ago, Heather and I started looking for property to create such a place.
 Now, to be honest, we actually started looking for property.
 I don't think we set out to find a place to nurture, but we set out to find land and build our home.
 Right?
 We got married.
 Yeah, we didn't think about. We knew we wanted to be on land.
 We figured we probably get like five acres that we would build a house and we had talked about at the time.
 We had talked about both of us have had health issues for a long period of time.
 Both of us have struggled. I'm still struggling through trying to get the lead out of my body,
 which is trying to get the lead out, which is an insanely long process and has such a bad effect on so many different things.
 A lot of struggles that you've experienced.
 And I struggle with Lyme disease and...
 Yeah, affects so much of your hormones and affects so much of how you might get sick off of the wrong things that fired up, whatever it is.
 So with that, we had this desire to get some land and actually grow our own food.
 Right? Have a garden, have chickens, we wanted to be able to know where our food was coming from, because unfortunately you don't know in the markets in the...
 And we eat pretty darn good.
 We do as much grass fed as we possibly can, pasture-a-s chickens, organic as much as we can possibly get it organic, which the word organic is not even what it used to mean anymore.
 But we don't eat crap.
 So with that being said, our desire and you really jumped in early on looking for properties.
 And we had these conversations and we focus a lot on God.
 We focus, you know, I mean, gosh, you guys have been hearing us for the longest time, talk about how important God is to us.
 And for us, God is more important than anything else, including each other.
 For us, God is number one, and then we are number two for each other.
 Nobody else could get us into heaven. Nobody else has our eternity in their hands except for God. And so, hey, that's how we live our life.
 So as we started looking at properties, things just didn't feel right.
 Things just, we looked at a bunch of different options. You had pulled up a bunch of different options.
 And it was like, none of this feels right.
 And we got to one, and we've been looking at how long have you, were you looking back during that time?
 I think we had been looking about nine months.
 By the time we got to the one property that we were like, okay, this is doable.
 I think we can make this work. You know, we spent some time in prayer, and we put a contract, a contract, don't we?
 We decided to say, hey, we're going to test this. We're not feeling like God saying yes, but we're not feeling totally that he's saying no.
 It just doesn't feel nothing has felt right.
 Here's where to solve this.
 We're going to put in this offer, and we're going to put all of these little disabilities on there and see what happens.
 Well, a lot of immediately came back. This is so funny. We are sitting at the table in the event center at the office.
 And my computer's open, your computer's open. We're working, and then all of a sudden you get the email and it's the deed.
 Yeah, and so the deed to the property that we put the bit on said absolutely no chickens, no goats.
 And so we were like, okay, God, there it is. We're not supposed to have this property.
 It said all these things that we could have do, which what against the things that we felt like we needed to do, or desired to do.
 Yeah, so it was like okay, and at the same time.
 At the same strange time, not strange at all. There's no coincidence.
 As I'm looking at you and I go, well, there's our answer.
 The preview pane of my email inbox popped in a property on a Zillow email, and it had this property.
 And I turned and I looked, I don't know, went, this is it.
 And I looked at open and you and I went, just picture after picture after picture.
 Or like, this, this is it. This is it.
 And I remember saying, hey, get our gal and have a call and you're like, you looked at it and you said it's got a contract.
 It says it's under contract and I was like, oh, no, no, sorry.
 I mean, once it goes to contract, chances of it falling through, you know,
 it's ridiculous. No, for to be even showing it that it's under contract, it's done.
 And this is 55 acres in an area of Tennessee called leapers fork.
 There's just no way.
 Right.
 And everything inside of me said, have a call.
 Yep.
 So you reached out to our rock star real estate agent.
 Gabriel.
 Gabriel.
 And he's just man. She's just a rock star. She's killed it.
 And two hours later, she calls you and said, hey, the contract fell through an hour ago.
 And man, oh, man, we just went to prayer, but here's the funny thing.
 Our prayer was not, oh, Lord, please let us have it.
 We started playing against it.
 God, if this is not your will, we do not want it.
 And we prayed and we prayed and we prayed and we prayed.
 And so we reached out and come to find out the owners were giving 24 more hours to the person who had the contract.
 Yeah, because they supposedly had a big wire coming in and all this stuff.
 And so we just get praying.
 Okay. If it's not for us, we don't want it.
 We don't want closest door, close the door, close the door.
 The next day, you got this thing from the Holy Spirit.
 I just felt the Lord say, hey, you need to, I mean, up to this point,
 the only thing that we've seen on the property were the pictures.
 Because we don't lie in the bed, like at night, seven o'clock at night.
 And it was like pitch black, we could see anything.
 And so I just felt the Lord say, hey, you need to go out there.
 You need to go out to the property.
 Yeah.
 And so you reached out to you.
 And I was like, hey, babe, I, you know, I feel like we need to go out there and see it.
 I went picture up, drove on out here.
 We drove up the hill, came to the top and we were just, it was just so beautiful.
 And it's so funny.
 I said, man, it would be funny if the owner was up here.
 Because the only thing up here at the time is a barn, a big barn.
 And they didn't live up here, but they just had the barn up here.
 And so we came up and sure enough, out walks this guy and I walk out to him.
 I said, hey, are you Randy?
 And that I looked on at his jacket.
 And a big patch says, Randy, you definitely ready.
 And we met the amazing Randy Barton who we are friends with.
 We're in Bible study together with today.
 Just amazing him and Sandra Barton, just phenomenal people.
 But we talked with Randy and we said, hey, we just felt like we were God called us up here to take a look.
 And he was so sweet.
 And he showed us around.
 We had a chance to walk the property and to just spend time and prayer.
 You know, he did make mention to go, well,
 you know, I'm giving him to midnight tonight and we're like, hey, this is going to sound strange,
 but we're actually praying against this.
 And I remember saying to go, hey, we're actually praying that this is not for us that he closes door.
 And it's ready to go as well.
 It's 330 right now because we spent some time.
 Because we don't do wire transfers.
 Because I don't think they do wire transfers this late or like, don't get excited.
 Don't get excited.
 So we prayed.
 We walked around.
 We drove around.
 We went all around the property down to the pond, all that fun stuff.
 And then came back.
 Same thing, pray through the night.
 Trusting God, trusting God, trusting God, trusting God.
 And then the next morning.
 I remember, I don't remember what it was, but you sent me.
 I sent you.
 It's so fused the crap out of me.
 I know.
 I sent him.
 I said, hey, we got any.
 I had no clue what that meant.
 I just wanted to break out in song and dance.
 I've got some any of you that remember the movie Annie.
 Which I have never really seen the whole Annie.
 When they got Annie, they broke out in song and dance.
 So I've got this text of we've got Annie.
 And I'm like, what in the world does that mean?
 And I'm like confused, concerned.
 Who is Annie?
 What is Annie?
 What is it?
 It's something like, what is that mean?
 And you're like, we got the property.
 We got it.
 We got the property.
 We purchased it, celebrated.
 We grew our relationship with Randy and Sandra and a bunch of other people as well.
 But as we came and we walked around and even the very first time we came up here,
 we felt that this property was way more for more than just us.
 Yeah, I think there was this sense of peace here.
 Whenever we were up here, you know, we still had our place that we were living at.
 And when we were there, we were like, let's go out to the property.
 We were wanting to be out here because it's so serene.
 And there is so much peace here.
 And we just felt the Lord's presence when we were out here.
 You know, and we started to feel that, you know, maybe other people needed to have that serenity and that peace and that safe haven and that refuge to be able to come to.
 And really quickly, you know, the more time we spent in prayer, we were feeling.
 God was calling us to make this more than just our land.
 We are firm believers that you need to submit everything that you have to God.
 We believe there is so for those of us that are believers, we are owned by God.
 We are to follow his will and his purposes for our lives.
 And so we believe that we are to submit everything our relationships, our finances, the things that we own everything to him, everything that's not submitted to him is still in the world.
 As far as we're concerned, what do I mean by that?
 If we have something, how do we use it for him?
 How do we use it to glorify him? How do we use it for his will and purposes?
 And as we spent time and prayer over this, we were looking for five acres.
 We got 11 times that amount.
 And it's like, we don't need this.
 We don't need this much, but we knew God put this in our hands and that this is something that he wanted us to have.
 And immediately we started feeling the, we need to create a place.
 So we're talking about our little garden that we're going to grow and chickens.
 Like a garden in chickens and you really wanted to count.
 That's what our, that's where we were.
 But then all of a sudden we start looking around and we start seeing amazing opportunities.
 We start seeing what a second. We have tons of them.
 What if we grew a huge market garden and we started providing that?
 Which by the way, we just mapped out.
 We just, you just mapped out.
 Phase number one is 5,500 square feet of food.
 Yeah, food that we can provide for people.
 To provide for people. And so we started recognizing that we could build stuff here.
 And you know, for us immediately the discussion that we had was, what would it be like for folks that are coming through next level of life to come and stay here?
 You know, you do next level of life out here and people love.
 They come to our offices and it's not like a normal office.
 It's not a corporate office. You come in and people say, man, this is like a home.
 It's like a house. And that's exactly how we wanted it built, right? That's what we wanted to be like.
 But then they go stay in a hotel.
 Right. And I remember you talking about, oh my gosh, what if we could put some small houses out here and they could walk through and pick, you know,
 if they wanted to make something up for themselves, like you pick from the garden and they could go walk through and, you know,
 when they're out there focusing on prayer and time and whatever,
 go stay in their own place out here, how much more healing would happen?
 Right.
 There's something about being in God's creation and being out on land and just, you know,
 being able to hike through the property and just having that solitude.
 You know, we don't get great internet reception up there or someone's going to get, don't work well up here, which is great.
 I mean, it's the perfect opportunity to just completely uncheck and spend time, you know, hiking through the property and walking down to the pond and, yeah,
 I wanted them to be able to, can you imagine staying up here going through such a life changing two day event and waking up and you have a basket of fresh produce, you know,
 on your doorstep where Catherine has gone and she's made fresh sourdough, um, I'm corn muffins and, and you have your being taking care of.
 We're going to be scottie that she makes her I'm corn, but I don't know.
 You're being taken care of and you're being nurtured spiritually.
 Fresh goat milk yogurt.
 Yeah.
 It's just, I wanted, yeah, I could see that life happening up here.
 So much more healing, so much more, you know, and we already have phenomenal programs and processes that help people and heal people and all that kind of stuff,
 but this just adds a different element from a holistic right for a leadership team going through Stratplan to be able to be out here as we take breaks and,
 you know, walk through the woods or sit out over the pond and, you know, experience life together.
 One of the great things in Stratplan is that time together as a leadership team outside of the, you know, when we're having dinner, you know,
 that time where we've got music playing and dinner and, you know, and everybody's enjoying each other's company.
 It's such such growth during that time and if they could not only have that experience, but then go stay here on the property as well.
 And not have to go back to hotel. That's the things that we're seeing. That's the things that we're experiencing and that's the things that we believe got us leading us to do.
 So what did we start with? Well, one of the first things we started with was honeybees and if you, if you've watched that, so as we're preparing the growth of this place,
 and there is so much to do and we are moving on building stuff out here, that's kind of getting held up as things do, which is funky, but it's all in God's timing.
 But then we start looking around going, okay, well, we have to prepare this land. It's 55 acres and only a couple of acres is actually cleared.
 And so after having spent a decent amount of money just brush hogging some areas that were cleared, Chris got an idea.
 We need goats.
 And I think if I remember correctly, we saw something.
 We saw something where people were renting goats or maybe it's we talked to.
 I think we were down at Davis general.
 We did we have Davis general market. And they were saying you could rent goats.
 Yes, that's true.
 We are the side of the property because we were telling them what we were doing, trying to clear some of the land and they were like, oh well, you know, you can rent goats.
 And we're like rent goats.
 Wait a second.
 If we can rent goats to clear our land, what would it mean to just buy goats?
 We just bought goats. How difficult does this? It's so we literally. And this is a business decision. We're like, okay, this is going to save us a lot of money of having to pay to bring this stuff down.
 So we start looking and goats. And I'm sure it was it had to have been you.
 I don't remember how it happened, but somehow we found that the highest butterfac content of milk comes from a Nigerian goat.
 And so now we're like, well, wait a second.
 Not only can we buy goats and put them on our land to clear the land naturally.
 Now we can also get milk from them and we can eat and make them.
 We can make goat.
 Yogurt and all these things.
 So that was like, okay, this is a fun idea.
 So we went on the hunt.
 We got goats. We got four dolings and we got three bucks.
 And we've been having fun ever since. And this has just been phenomenal.
 We fence them in and put them in and oh my gosh.
 We've been able to see more of our land because of the work that those goats have done by tearing stuff down, eating it,
 you know, and clearing stuff out. And the great thing is we just keep moving along and they just keep working.
 They're work goats.
 But, praise Lord, we are new team members.
 There are new team members.
 There are first actual team members on the ridge outside of UNI.
 But we have successfully bred at least one so far.
 We should have one.
 We should have one here.
 Little ones here.
 Come in the future.
 March.
 Yeah.
 So we did that.
 We got honey bees.
 If you've not seen the honey bee.
 Honey bee episodes.
 The saga.
 It was so funny.
 We were just putting stuff out there about how having these bees and the struggles that we went through and they got attacked by wasps and all the stuff.
 We were posted in some of these videos out there.
 Just because we're like, "Ah, people, you know, we just want to show people what's going on."
 And we had people going, "What's happened with the bees?"
 Where are they?
 We haven't seen anything new.
 What's going on with the bees?
 What's happening?
 It was so fun to see the people who were going to do that.
 The bees are doing good.
 They're nice and toasty for winter.
 We had to combine our two hives because my queen stopped producing eggs.
 And so we had to combine the two of them.
 They both got both hives got attacked and dropped the population considerably.
 So we had to put them together all as well.
 You can see the saga on YouTube.
 How's your the ridge?
 Yeah, what is it?
 Experience the ridge.
 From there, I know this sounds like, you know, what are they talking about?
 All of these pieces have been aspects of what we believe God's calling us to do with this land.
 As we've had the goats up here, people have started coming.
 We've had to start with team members.
 I want to go see.
 I want to bring my kids.
 And it's been stunning to see the kids responses.
 Katie heard, son, just showed did not want to leave the property.
 He wanted to take one of them.
 One of the goats with them.
 Yeah, with them.
 And then we had homeschool kids out here.
 And we've had people show up.
 And it's been amazing.
 We're not even where we think we want to be with this place yet.
 And it's already having a couple of times.
 Yeah, the healing and the community that it's creating, you know, the ability for homeschool
 moms to come out here and for us to be able to explain the life of a bee and for the kids to learn and grow.
 Experience the goats experience the guineas.
 Oh, that's another thing.
 So I guess that's the next that's the next phase.
 The next edition, where are the guineas?
 Oh, we, so we're up here. And what do we have?
 And 55 acres of forest in the south.
 In the south.
 Ticks and chickens.
 And oh my gosh.
 The ticks love Heather and the chiggers love me.
 Oh my gosh.
 I couldn't walk outside without coming back and having like 20 bites and that just it was terrible.
 So I did an all kinds of research and could not find anything that really just got rid of
 chiggers except guineas.
 Guinea hints.
 So chickens will eat ticks, but they don't eat the chiggers.
 But guineas eat ticks and that what they do is all of the blades of grass or whatever the
 Chiggers are on, they wipe it with their beaks and then they eat the chiggers.
 So we immediately, you went and researched, found some chicken or it's found some
 Chiggers found some guineas.
 We bought guineas and we let them roam around and within what a couple of weeks.
 Probably three, four weeks.
 Yeah.
 I could actually walk outside.
 Yeah.
 Where they've been, not beyond the not beyond that part, but where they've been and have no problems
 whatsoever.
 I mean, it's just been insane.
 Are the spider populations come down?
 The millipede population has come down.
 All the bugs around where they've been, it's all dropped immensely, which is just fabulous.
 Yeah, it's been great.
 So they're on the homes that are there, workers as well.
 So we have, we have the goats that are naturally taking down all of the stuff that helps
 us to clear out the land and see what we've got.
 We have the bees that are going to be providing for us.
 We have the goats that are going to be providing for us.
 We have the guineas that not only have they literally destroyed a lot of the tick and
 sugar population around us, but they produce amazing eggs, which will start.
 Which will start utilizing the land and the furl, yes.
 Which is a good plus for the garden.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.
 And then we added a couple of peacocks.
 Oh, we did.
 Yeah.
 So we actually just for those.
 Those are just ornaments.
 Really, we've got two peacocks and they're just armoured.
 They're pretty.
 They're pretty.
 But we had to get power up here.
 We had water, which was great, but we have had a lot.
 This was such a long, painful, expensive process to get power up the hill.
 Had to get new bridges in, had to get a lot of rock just hammered out.
 We've had some great help on that.
 Just amazing process to get power up the hill.
 We finally got it.
 We started the process in February.
 We finally got the power when a couple months ago August.
 I was going to say August.
 I think it was August.
 It took that long, fresh to get power up here.
 Well, we can't move forward underneath the building until we get this up here.
 We can't move forward on.
 Yeah.
 I mean, there's so many things that we had to get done.
 And then, all right, we finally got this going.
 Let's go back to codes.
 Nope.
 This isn't ready.
 This isn't prepared.
 Nope.
 You got to change this.
 So we're in the process, right?
 Any of you out there who have built a home probably have free into the same thing.
 I'm just, you know, this is not the first time.
 Yeah, this is, this is not the first time we've experienced this.
 Or I've experienced this.
 I know you've experienced it as well.
 With all of that said, some of the interesting things that have happened along the way.
 Have been so prayer-focused and so trusting.
 I've got great clients and friends that have reached out and said, you know, they know the process.
 We've spent time together.
 We've talked through stuff and I had a client just a couple of weeks ago.
 How are you doing this?
 How are you not taking control?
 Because the truth is, I could control a whole lot of stuff and make a whole lot of things happen.
 And instead of controlling these things and instead of jumping in and forcing things to happen.
 Because here's what I've learned in my 51 years of life, almost 52.
 Is that when I control things, I'm removing God's input.
 I'm removing God's control.
 And the whole time he's saying to me, be diligent.
 Let me make things happen.
 It's not just me saying it to every single human being, right?
 Be diligent, trust me.
 Trust that I'm the one who provided this place.
 Trust that I'm the one who made the email drop at the right time.
 But I put your attention on this.
 That I'm the one while you're praying saying, close the doors.
 I'm not closing this door.
 I'm opening this door.
 Trust me that everything happened exactly the way that I wanted it to.
 And trust me that I'm going to make everything fall in line when I want.
 And so we've had some conversations where it's been,
 things have slowed down, which is actually, there's a lot of great benefits.
 When we got to the other side, when we were going to start the building, had everything happened,
 it was at the height of the lumber price increase.
 Well, price got to say just from that.
 And there've been a couple other things that have happened since, right?
 So interestingly, what we've experienced is things aren't going the way we would want it to.
 We have two options.
 Chris, jumps in and takes control and starts making things happen.
 Or we just sit back and we go, we're trust God.
 We be diligent.
 We keep moving forward with what we believe he's taught us to do.
 But we're going to trust God.
 And I think that's been great for a lot of folks to hear how have you done that.
 And the answer simply is this.
 It's been time after time after time of seeing what happens when I take control.
 And time after time after time after time of going.
 Nope.
 Trust.
 Let go.
 Trust God.
 Watch what he does.
 And then see what happens and see what the difference is as well.
 Don't just wait for him to do it.
 You know, stop.
 We're not sitting back going, oh my gosh, we're going to wait for God to swoop in here and build a building.
 We're saying we're trusting the proud we're pushing where we can.
 We're asking questions.
 We're gaining perspective.
 We're doing what we can.
 But when we run into those roadblocks, we don't force our way through it.
 Right.
 Yeah, because again, you know, back to the whole original property, if we would have pushed that and pushed that and didn't stop and trust, you know, we would have been there in a situation where we couldn't add animals, where we couldn't do the things that, you know, we had wanted to do.
 And so we couldn't help but we couldn't have other people show up and be a part of it and be part of the healing.
 And I mean, we could have obviously we could have.
 But it wouldn't be the things that we feel like God shown us here.
 So let me just stop there and ask you because people, a lot of people have asked me, Chris, how have you done this and what has it been like to, you know, trust and not take control and it's been enlightening for them.
 I haven't asked you.
 What has it been like for you in this process of just trusting?
 I think for me, there's these moments of hurry up, I'm ready, you know.
 And also, I think we've been walking this walk of stop pray, stop pray.
 When things don't go the way that we think they're supposed to go, it's been this stop and pray and stop and pray.
 And so many times I've seen it was like, no, don't turn right turn left.
 Ah, so that's why this didn't happen.
 Yeah, you know, we've seen that over and over again and every time I see that there's this confidence that's being built in me on being able to trust God more.
 And to have a spouse and to have a partner who is strong in his faith and I see that it's easier for me as a woman to trust, you know, to sit back and go, okay, let's continue to pray.
 Yeah, I think one of the things I love because in the very beginning when we were looking at properties before we got to this, you had some frustrations of this isn't this isn't going right and then when we hit the let's back up pray trust, I think the thing that I have loved watching.
 Obviously as your husband is you grow in that moment, but my gosh, what you have done with the kids, the conversations that you've had since even just this specific situation of trust, no you trust, no don't force that, no don't.
 Conversations that you've had with the kids, whether it's things that they're doing or their marriages or whatever, it has been a blessing to watch you take this experience and many, many others where you've trusted God and not forced it to happen and help them to see listen if you walk this out.
 And I think that's just so powerful for me as your husband to watch that happen because we're crazy about the girls we love him we've got five and ten grandkids.
 For some and loss so we've got a great large family and it's awesome to be able to be teaching them these aspects of faith and watching you walk that out I think it's just been I love it's just been a blessing for me.
 Sweet I don't know I don't know what to say.
 I don't think you have to say I just think it's been it's just been another blessing of God when he says trust me and we do it doesn't stop there again it's one thing to say yeah I trust him.
 But what are your actions speaking to those around you and so it's been a great testimony to be able to teach through those hard times or through the frustrations or through the disappointments because things aren't going the way that you envisioned being able to sit back and go yeah but God's God's plan is always better you know it's always better than you could envision.
 So when we come back what does it look like to continue to walk in God's will and purposes in your life we'll talk about that when we come back.
 Folks if you've been listening to me for any length of time then you know the number one issue when it comes to business when it comes to family when it comes to friendships is having a lack of high quality communication.
 You make sure that you are absolutely winning in every aspect of your life it all starts with having great communication the best way to get that communication is to understand your personality style and to understand the personality style of the folks that you're spending the most time with whether be at work or there be at home.
 The best way to do that is to go to crissacrittle.com/store and get your personality profile and personality profiles for your team to day get it for your family members to day as you go through that profile you will begin to see the greatest ways to communicate go to crissacrittle.com/store today.
 So as we're discussing the rich we're up here we're enjoying this we love this place we can't stand leaving this place we've got so many great plans and vision that we believe we have from God but this is also cut in to our time this is this process of setting this up to continue our business it's funny we're setting up a homestead that is.
 Preparing a way for us to add our business to it so that we can have greater impact we're not stopping anything that we're doing we're not changing anything well there's actually one little thing that we've changed and that is you.
 We have actually pulled you back from some of the stuff inside of the business so that you can prepare the way be more focused on the things up here I still am.
 And I've got one dedicated day a week that I can put into getting things going up here and making things happen a lot of times that works out sometimes it doesn't work I just kind of depends on what we got going on.
 I'm not doing this way to do this well there's one thing about me that I don't know if a lot of people know this but I know a decent amount of our clients to if we can't do it with excellence I'm just not going to do it.
 Now that doesn't apply to every single thing you know if I can't butter my bread and I'm lying to the homestead it doesn't get any.
 I'm not going to do it.
 And a lot of stuff have not been excellent but praise God we still have all our animals we're doing we're doing a good.
 Yeah that's well we don't have all of our goals that's we actually we did lose some stuff that we did not know but yeah no that's like that is a great point.
 We have had the be saga which was just craziness we did lose some getting is not knowing that they can't see it.
 I know what the beauty about that though is that's part of life I mean you can't just there's so many people out there that actually don't do or don't move on God's word or what they're feeling they're being called to do because they don't have all the answers because they don't I mean.
 That's so true look at Moses right just do God God's going to provide the water God's going to give you the education you're going to stumble you're going to fall you may be close to drowning but it's okay just get in the water and try to swim right.
 I think of the what's his name Noah what's there.
 Yes from the notebook.
 From the notebook.
 Get in the water.
 I'm sorry I'm so sorry I'm sorry getting the water.
 We had so I should refraze what I mean if I'm going to do something that affects people if I'm going to do something that's for clients.
 If I'm going to do something that is what we expect to be life change or life perspective gathering or whatever if it's going to affect people and we can't do with excellence I don't want to do it.
 We have gone into this process up here at the ridge.
 I haven't said what we call to ridge.
 Oh that's so funny.
 It's called the ridge because it's a big horseshoe shaped ridge.
 We have down in the middle is our pond and we have this big ridge that goes all the way around and then in the back of the top I don't know what you would call that the big curve part.
 We have passed on in back there as well so it actually squares out back there but it's a big horseshoe shaped ridge.
 That's why we call it the ridge.
 So we have gone into this thing with we don't know.
 We're going to research as much as we possibly can but we're going to move forward.
 We're not going to wait for it to be perfect.
 Again that's another trusting that God will provide.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Because he says ask and I will give you.
 If you are lacking wisdom ask and I'll give it to you.
 So what does 22 look like for the ridge?
 Well we were trying to get this ecosystem in place and stabilized.
 We literally just added one of the most exciting things for us.
