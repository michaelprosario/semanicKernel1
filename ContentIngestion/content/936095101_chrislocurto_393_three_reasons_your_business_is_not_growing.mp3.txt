 Welcome to the Chris LaCardos Show, where we discuss leadership and life and discover that
 business is what you do, not who you are.
 [MUSIC]
 Welcome to the show, folks.
 Hope you were having a fantastic day wherever you are.
 Today joining the Instidio again is one Joel Forger.
 Hello, welcome back, Joel.
 Good to be back.
 It's good to have you back.
 Thank you.
 Not that I don't see you every day.
 [LAUGH]
 What's good to have you back on the show.
 So our fabulous listeners get a chance to hear some great insight from you.
 But today's a little different than you and me bantering back and forth.
 What's going on today?
 Yeah, that's right.
 So I ran out on the, especially for those who've listened to the show for a long time.
 I have a tendency to come in here and still the show over now and then.
 So I'm going to do that again.
 And so I'm going to interview Chris today.
 Interview you as I stare over the top of my mic and look at you.
 Interview you today about growing your business and specifically three keys,
 three reasons why small business owners, small business leaders,
 struggle to grow their business.
 So we're going to get into all of that today.
 So if that sounds like you folks out there definitely stick with this entire episode.
 Because I'm going to try to extract this much wisdom at a Chris is possible today.
 Yeah, so as we hit this, one of the key things that we do in our business.
 You know, we've been, we've been helping leaders, business owners, individuals for very long time.
 And one of the things that we have always focused on is not here's the magic pill.
 We have no magic pills here. There are plenty of people out there selling magic pills.
 That is not what we do. We help people to find the things holding them back.
 Whether it's in life, whether it's in leadership, whether it's in your business, whether it's in your leadership team,
 whether no matter what it is, we're always going to go after those reasons that you're not growing.
 Those reasons that you're struggling and the reasons that you're, you know,
 you're plateaued in whatever area it is. And as we do that, it helps you get things freed up so that you can move forward.
 And today we're going to focus that heavily on business.
 So we're going to be talking about that when we come back right after this.
 Hey, leaders. This is Joel Fortner, VP, a leadership development at Chris Lcarado's company.
 I have some questions for you.
 Do you as a leader feel like you are caught up in a crazy cycle of stress and tasks that never ends week to week?
 Do you ever have to deal with tough conversations with team members?
 And you sit at home the next day, the night before worried about how's it going to go?
 What am I going to say? What are they going to say? Can I think fast enough on my feed?
 Is it going to be a total failure? Are you experiencing culture problems or that stuff that just breaks down trust and unity on your team?
 Well, if you can relate to any of this, this is a pretty typical leadership story in situation.
 Here's the thing though. It doesn't have to be that way.
 And we can help you solve these things. We can help you become the leader that solves these problems and leads 13 to greater success.
 I want to introduce you to the key leaders program.
 This is an ongoing leadership development program that gives you the less-entrak coaching and accountability you need to become the leader you can become.
 To actually implement what you're actually learning in this program.
 Things fall apart without great leadership and intentionality.
 If you want to solve the problems that are holding you back from being a great leader, we can help you with this program.
 Get in touch with Joel at ChrisLecordo.com.
 Hi, we are back. Joel Ford and taking it away.
 Hey, so just in case you're not familiar with me in your new to the show because it seems like there are new people listening all the time.
 All the time.
 But on the team here, I'm the VP leadership development.
 So I run that stuff. I coach clients all the time.
 Coach small business owners, entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, leaders, nearly daily in the business.
 So we're going to dive in just like we said a few minutes ago or just a second ago or ever how long that break was.
 We're going to dive into stuff that holds you back from growing your business.
 Is that most, most leaders, most owners, they're after growth of some sort.
 They may not after be our be after I'm, I mean crazy aggressive growth.
 Some of you are, but some of you all are just after healthy, sustainable, very slow growth and there's nothing wrong with that.
 It's your choice.
 It's what you want to do with your business.
 But it's really important as you were saying a little while ago, I'm to solve what holds you back reasons why you're not growing.
 As we often say, it's like sometimes defining revenue isn't the hardest thing in a business.
 Often times it's pretty easy, but it's really difficult identifying and solving what's holding you back from actually growing and scaling in a better way.
 And as we say with excellence.
 And folks, as you're saying there, we do have, we have clients that want to grow intensely, which we help them do that.
 And we have clients that just want a smooth operating business. Here's one thing we do believe around here.
 You do need to be growing because things around you are growing, inflation grows, you know, things are changing, costs of your products are growing.
 You give team members, raises, all those things.
 So we don't ever tell anybody no stakes.
 Things are happening your business tags exactly where you are.
 We always want to look for some level of growth.
 We do again tend to help people find a heck of a lot of growth.
 And like you mentioned, a lot of money that they weren't planning on.
 But everybody needs to be growing.
 And that's why to grow even if you love where you are.
 If you're happy with the growth of your business, then it is a fantastic idea to get in and remove the things that are holding you back to make it even easier that you can continue to sustain growth even if you don't want to go after a ton.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 So let's dive into this a little bit and hit these three, three keys that we see a whole lot.
 The first reason we see a lot of businesses not growing is because they have such a focus on the numbers, not on the people.
 Explain more what we mean there.
 This is a tough one.
 So we have a lot of clients that are listening right now going, oh, he's talking about me.
 Because this is not an uncommon thing.
 This is what's taught.
 People are taught to chase the number.
 We have a lot of clients that are stuck in a process where they keep putting up a number and saying, "Team, go make that number happen."
 You have a business owner.
 You have a business leader, a team leader who throws up a number and says, you know what we did?
 I don't know.
 We did a million in this area last year.
 We had a 20% growth.
 We should be able to do 1.2 million this year.
 Guys, go make 1.2 million happen.
 And then they push and push and cram this number into their teams.
 Well if you're working with just one team, it may not be as difficult of a process because you're probably speaking more consistently with that one team.
 But even then what you're doing is you're going about it the wrong way.
 So overall, let me say, the big issue is you keep trying to make people had a number.
 Now in your mind, you might be hearing that and going, well, what in the world is wrong with that isn't that that's what I was taught.
 That's what my other entrepreneur friends have been taught.
 That's what the other leaders I know that they've been taught.
 Why is that an issue?
 Here's the reason why this is a problem.
 Every time you put up a number and you base that number, usually on some sort of historical number, you base it on some sort of percentage of growth, you base it on.
 I think I want to stretch this thing out a little bit.
 And what you don't do is get the number or information from the team or teams that are involved on what they can do, what they need for help, what's holding them back.
 What you do is you give this number to people, teams, team leaders and say, go after this thing and they have no ownership.
 This is probably one of the biggest issues with that number.
 They hear the number, they know that they're going to be held accountable for the number, but it doesn't mean anything to them.
 They didn't come up with a number.
 So when you have multiple teams, what tends to happen is you have multiple people that go, hey, I hear your number.
 Nothing to me, I'm going to go back and do my work that I do every single day, the way that I know how to do it and struggle things that struggle through the things that I'm struggling through.
 So they don't take ownership, which means they don't really have buying.
 Even if you have great leaders, they may have buy into the number, but at the end of the day, all they can do is the same thing that they've been doing for the last 12 months, you know, 24 months, 36 months, whatever they've been doing,
 but the numbers that they have.
 So you lose out on this great opportunity.
 So the shift in focus needs to be, don't go, don't drive a number into your team or into your teams.
 Now, a lot of folks have multiple teams out there.
 Don't drive the number into your teams instead.
 I'm going to use an example of one of a, we did a recent strap plan with a phenomenal company who has just been killing it and implementing the things that came out of strap plan.
 I mean, it's just, it's awesome to watch how well they're doing, but as we went into the process, that number was so ingrained.
 It was, it's an industry type of way of leading your business.
 You go out to the number, you go out to the number, you go out to the number, and I just kept pounding guys dropped the number, guys dropped the number,
 and finally at what point it was like, but why?
 And I'm like, watch this and they had one, two, three, four, five different teams, team leaders sitting around the table and I want to each team lead.
 And I want, if we, and we've already discovered strap plan, we discover all the things holding you back, all the stuff that needs to be fixed, all the stuff that we can do.
 And then we find money on top of it, on average, like 2.1 million more than they're even thinking about.
 And so I looked to the first team, we didn't know I'm like, if we focus on all these things we found in your area, and we killed those, I mean, we just knocked it out, we fixed those things.
 How much more money can you do in 2021 than you didn't 2020?
 And he put up a number that was just stunning.
 It was bigger, it was bigger not that I was going to, I was like a fantastic number, and what was, let's be conservative, let's back this down, what's a conservative number, you know that is the conservative number.
 And I went around the table to each of the team, this isn't the first time this has happened, we do this, this happens all the time.
 And I went around to each team leader, and as I focused on what we could do to fix the teams, the, you know, the people underneath them, the area, the things that they're trying to do, soft problems, make things work better, over and over again, each team leader added a number that by the time we were done, the number from fixing the five teams was
 twice as much revenue as the number they were trying to get them to go chase.
 Twice is much revenue, and we're talking about millions of dollars here.
 So here's the key, once we did that, it was this big light bulb of, oh crap, we keep pushing a number and expecting them to hit it, and if they hit that number we're happy.
 And when they're not hitting that number, we're pushing and I'm going, why don't you get into this number.
 But if we back up and do this instead of chasing the number, if we back up and do it, Chris is telling us to do, fix the problems, solve the problems, discover the things that are wrong, let's go after these things first, then we actually put up twice the amount of revenue.
 What if we're half wrong, then we actually hit the number that we've adjacent the whole tide.
 Yeah, we're great.
 So that is probably one of the biggest things that we see is people always think if we go chase a number and we get it, praise God, how low you we get it.
 Instead of recognizing, don't let the number be the lead.
 Make the fixes be the things that you go after, make the solution be the thing, make communication and culture be something that's so strong and so powerful that it rises above the number that you're thinking in the first place.
 Yeah, so you're not anti number.
 No, not at all.
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
 The business, then you will have a much greater perspective on what the number should be and could be. So let me say it that way. I'm glad you pointed that out.
 Absolutely.
 And look at what the number could be when you tax the collective intelligence and go get the perspective.
 And you focus on if we can free you up in these ways, you may discover like you're pointing out, you may discover that number that you may think is fantastic is actually a lowball.
 So, and then you're it's like you're pushing a rock uphill because you keep the teams that have problems that have not been solved yet.
 The teams that are struggling, the team members, the communication, the culture, you know, all of these, the accountability, all these things that are struggling inside of your business.
 What's happening is you keep pushing a number on top of that and not fixing any of that.
 So even if you get to that number, you probably have higher turnover, you probably have bigger other issues because you're getting to that number with a bunch of crap that's happening.
 It's out of the business.
 That way, I'm solved yet.
 So what do you what do you normally see, Chris, that if you are a leader pushing a number in your team still has all these break pedals on them that they don't even maybe recognize all the stuff that's holding them back.
 But their leader keeps coming to them saying, come on, let's go, what happens to the team?
 What you see more than anything is a loss of morale.
 Now you'll probably have a good team leader that's loyal, hopefully you've got somebody who's loyal and is like, you know, one to fight the battle with you.
 But eventually what's going to happen is even that person's going to get tired of the fight.
 Because they're probably bringing things to the table and saying, I have struggles here. Well, you know, okay, we'll fix that as soon as we get to, yeah, just make that happen.
 Yeah, just fix that thing, man, just get that thing done because the numbers, the important thing.
 What happens is the people under that leader are going to lose morale. They're probably going to get fearful. They're probably going to be looking for another place to go.
 They're probably going to feel like they're never recognized for how hard they work and when they are recognized, it's almost always about the number.
 So what you tell the team member is they're worth to the business is the number that gets put up.
 Okay, so what? That's not exactly the greatest way to lead people, right?
 Because they need to know that you actually treat them with dignity and you care about them as individuals.
 Yeah, so what happens is is that we start to find people who are not getting problems solved, they get tired. They get done with it. They're like, well, I can go somewhere else and have less problems.
 We get people that are loyal that you can run over with a steam roller, but after about 40 times they like forget this noise, I'm just going to look for some other place to go that's less stressful.
 But here's the biggest issue. Everybody who stays on the team is going to put up 50% of the productivity that they could do if they were treated well,
 not led well given the opportunities taking care of 50% they will do the minimum that they can to get a paycheck and keep a job.
 And what the reason for that is is because they get tired of running into the wall, they get tired of keeping problems are like, well, screw this.
 I'm just going to do what I can, right? So even your most loyal people aren't going to keep putting their heads on the chopping block because you keep chopping it off, right? There's no ROI here for them.
 So what you end up doing is paying twice the amount in salary and payroll to a team to accomplish the number that you're trying to get them to accomplish.
 The converse of this is if you actually solve all the problems down inside that team or teams, then they can work at a much greater capacity.
 You're not hiring more people, you're not paying more people, you're not adding more payroll and now you're getting a much greater productivity and the morale is just so much higher.
 Yeah, so that's fantastic. That guys, I hope you're getting in your, like, if you need to replay that, replay that, but if you're finding yourself leading really heavily with numbers and you're hearing this and this is resonating, this is just that's fantastic information.
 So guys, we're going to dive into the next two big reasons that hold you back from going your business right after this.
 What if I told you that it's possible to grow your business, develop your leadership and even make your team successful right now where you are even in the middle of an economic crisis?

 Welcome back everyone. Chris, we discovered key number one about this whole issue with leading by the number, not leading people as well as you need to.
 The second reason is that this is a big part of what we talk about a lot.
 What happens is that there are so much people getting stuck in the list. The leadership is this place where you can be a team leader, you can be a business owner, doesn't matter who you are.
