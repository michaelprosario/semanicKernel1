 The eight negative people you should avoid that is coming up next
 Welcome to the Chris LaCardo show where we discuss leadership and life and discover that business is what you do not who you are
 Welcome to the show folks
 Today we are talking about negative people and so as we hit this topic
 There's some caveats. I want to make sure that you understand a
 One of those caveats is you may be one of the negative people we're gonna talk about today
 So keep that in mind as we go through this one of our core values here at the point main group is that everybody has a root system honor that
 You know everybody has
 Something in their life in their past and their in their root system that causes them to see the world in a
 Negative aspect now for those of us that are believers
 We're born into a negative world. We're born into sin right?
 We're born into a world that is not our home. I mean, this is we're here for short period of time
 The next one's the important one right getting it right here
 Makes the important difference in the next life
 But while we're here that doesn't mean that we're not gonna face or experience
 negative situations now if you are operating from a heart of love
 Which is incredibly difficult to do with everybody on the planet
 Then you're able to see that people struggle you're able to see that sometimes people are negative
 And it could be because of something they're experiencing in their life
 There's so many times that I help team members or clients to look at a situation and then I say to them
 Let me ask you this. What do you think they're experiencing right now? Why do you think that they might be negative right now?
 So as we go through this I want that to be a major focus because
 You're still
 Probably need to get some negativity out of your life
 Especially for folks that are coming in next-level life we talk about this all the time
 And one of the things we help them to see is that when you're leaving next-level life if you have a lot of negativity in your life
 Then guess what in the beginning you're gonna have to put in some solid boundaries
 Eventually as you get healthy
 Er yourself
 Then you can start you know moving the boundaries closer and closer and closer because you're able to handle situations with the tools that we give you
 But in the beginning there's some folks that leave that man they gotta go put in strong boundaries throughout away some folks
 It's not even an issue. We have some folks that man they come through this event and
 The folks that you see in their life are incredibly healthy. I mean just great people to have around them
 But that's not everybody so
 Depending upon the strength that you have to be able to deal with these situations
 At the same time you're trying to understand your root system and understand why things are affecting you the way they are why you may be choosing negativity
 Why you may be choosing
 You know some bad decision making in your life you may have to be strong
 You may have to put some things in place to keep negative people out of your life
 Who might those negative people be? It could be anybody that could be family friends
 Teachers leaders co-workers
 It could be anybody that you experience sometimes it could be the person that you that is serving you when you go get your coffee in the mornings
 Maybe you need to choose a different place to go get coffee. It could be anybody the point is
 That if you're gonna get healthy or
 So that you can handle situations better it's smart to make sure that you're putting things in place to keep negative people out of your life now for most people
 Their family makes up the majority of of the areas that we're talking about
 We would all love for our family to have an incredible positive impact on us some people do
 Some folks have families that are just incredibly
 Selfless and very loving
 That isn't the norm that we discover here that's not the most of people
 But it is great to see when folks come through and that's exactly what they experience
 Sometimes the people that are coming through are those amazing people that
 That are very strong very selfless
 Very solid in their relationships, but for a lot of folks that's not what the experience they experience long lasting negative effects
 From family from friends from close people in their lives
 So keep in mind I said for a lot of folks not everybody is like that
 I just had a gentleman going through next-level life who had the greatest loving parents I've seen
 I mean just
 powerful
 Great loving parents in fact to some extent to loving
 Not allowing this person to experience tough situations in life to make better decisions
 So phenomenally loving people not negative very positive
 Even to the point where again like I say
 It wasn't there were some areas that were holding this person back because they hadn't had the opportunity to go get
 You know kicked in the teeth by life so as I share with every next-level life attendee
 Who has the negative impacts we don't make any monsters and we don't make any victims
 We focus on discovering why these things are
 So as we may talk through and discover that there's negativity in somebody's life
 We're not going to sit there and make them a victim or make a monster out of the person who's bringing the negativity
 Why because that's pointless
 Right we call it the surface level responses here. Let me teach you how to cope with this person or the situation
 We blow right past that
 We get down into the why is this happening why is this person choosing to make these decisions
 Why are you choosing to make your decisions?
 We have had person after person. I mean folks that have been going to counselors for a decade
 Folks that have been going to multiple counselors that come through next-level life and as they go through
 They're like we've never hit this level of stuff ever
 And it's because as we share with them we don't focus on coping with the surface level response
 We help you to see why it's there in the first place
 When you discover that information you can make completely different decisions like putting in healthy boundaries
 It's very difficult to put in a healthy boundary with somebody that you're still getting your worth from and you don't understand why
 And you don't think that you are or you you think that you've got it under control
 And you think that you've you've stopped dealing with that all my hideees out there all my hideees always coming
 Oh, yeah, I I've got done dealing with that a long time ago
 Really you mean you swept it under the rug and it's gonna pop up here in a conversation about 30 minutes
 Yeah, absolutely you know
 You'll see some of the stuff that we feel like we dealt with and we think we're done with and then come to find out
 We're still making decisions based on that junk so
 Like I say we want to get to the to the why why?
 Why does this exist the deeper level in the root system to discover why these things are down here?
 So as we go through this if you've not been through next-level life
 My biggest suggestion is to try and figure out how to put healthy boundaries in place
 There's a bunch of tools that we give you through the event but this is some stuff that you can start doing right now
 Start avoiding these processes so that you can get healthier but listen
 If you're not focusing on getting you healthier than you're just a victim
 All right everybody's negative and I can't do anything about it. Well now you're a victim
 So you can't be that you can you can choose that but that's not gonna grow if you're listening to this show my assumption is
 You're wanting to grow you because the things we discuss are growing you so
 Make sure that as you're setting healthy boundaries or removing
 Possibly these types of people from your life that you're focusing on getting strong girl
 I'm always gonna point you straight to Jesus
 That's gonna be the best place for you to go to get your strength if you're not spending a lot of time in his word
 You're missing out you do not understand that this is a living breathing word the word of God
 So spend time with him spend time growing spend time obviously putting tools in place that we talk about
 To get you better in a better situation if all you do is listen to this kind of stuff and then look at everybody
 I'll some point your friend or you're not learning you're not getting it. It's much more than that
 At the end of the day our goal is guiding everybody to be able to love other people even those that are struggling
 Even the negative people even the abusive controlling people you don't have to like them
 You don't have to have them in your life
 But understand that they're coming from a jacked up background as well and it probably a pretty bad root system as well
 So let's dive right in and and I will as we go through this. I want you to ask yourself the question be honest
 Once again, I don't want you to focus on this as in being a victim in this process
 I want you to ask the serious question do I have these people in my life in which ones?
 So write them down as we talk about it and let's start thinking through what are we going to do?
 How are we going to put healthy boundaries in place? How are we going to get you healthy earth?
 So the first person I want to focus on the first person that you probably should avoid
 This is the nice air. This is the person who constantly says
 Whatever you propose to do will not work
 They have every reason and excuse in the book while you will fail at pretty much everything you try to do
 A bunch of people we start off with the nest with the naysayer and a bunch of people are like yep
 And usually we point to a specific parent pretty quickly or we point to a sibling a controlling sibling
 Maybe sometimes it might even be a leader
 But this is the kind of person who is constantly telling you oh, yeah, that's not going to work
 No, no, that's not going to work. Now I want you to understand this is not necessarily the same thing
 For a lot of folks that are high s out there which is a good portion of the followers of the show right a good portion of you are high s
 Sometimes you you struggle so much with change that you can be very quick to say that's not going to work
 That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about a person who looks at you as an individual and says you're going to fail
 You're not good enough. You know, none of the stuff that you're trying to do is ever going to work
 Here's what I can promise you the longer you stick around
 Folks that say stuff like that that talk to you that way that treats you that way
 The more it's going to get beaten into your head that you can't do it
 Here's the bad side of that
 The more that gets beaten into your head
 The more you're going to go off and do stupid things to try and prove them wrong
 The more you're going to go focus on
 You know just bearing your head in something and saying forget the world right now
 I'm going to go do this thing so I can prove that one person wrong
 Forget enjoying life forget God forget any of this stuff. I've got to prove this person wrong
 There's two things you're looking for when you do this
 The first thing is to prove them wrong. I can do this. I am good enough. I am able
 The second thing you may be looking for and this is really difficult to understand if this hits home then
 You know it'll make sense pretty quickly
 But it's tough for people to understand this and see this until they're going through next-level life
 And once they do see it, well, it just blows them away
 You may be looking
 to be a firm
 That what that person is saying
 is true
 If you're trying to prove this person wrong if you are making bad decisions
 Unhealthy decisions and unhealthy decisions may be
 Bearing yourself into something to try and make it where you're achieving something to prove this person wrong
 And missing out on life and missing out on family and missing out on you know God
 right
 a lot of times we will step out and make bad decisions
 To prove people either wrong
 Or unfortunately
 many times we're trying to prove them right
 We're trying to prove that the naysayer is correct. I am a failure. I do fail at everything. There isn't anything I'm able to pull off
 Either way you look at this the choices that you're making the decisions that you're making are hurting you
 What's the right thing to do?
 Put some distance between you and that naysayer or naysayers
 Some of you have a family of naysayers some of you come from a family and it's just gets blown away with oh
 That's just the way the family is we're just passionate
 Oh, you're a bunch of naysayers
 You're so negative. Nobody can pull anything off
 Some of you just need to put some distance in there right and put healthy people around you
 People that are gonna look at you and say yes you can do this or hey that's really actually kind of stupid for you to go have to that
 What are you looking for? Why are you trying to accomplish something like that? What is it that you need? Where's your worth coming from?
 Right so the naysayer first person we want to put some distance
 Between us
 If possible and again focus on the positive that focus on the healthy the second person
 No at all no matter how much you know from experience from learning or God given a wisdom
 No at all always tries to make you feel like you're an idiot now keep in mind
 Nobody can make you feel that way they can highly suggest that you are but they're constantly suggesting that
 You're an idiot and none of your thoughts or ideas have merit
 This is again the same type of thing is the naysayer somebody who is constantly looking to get their worth by knocking you down
 If they can make you look stupid if they can convince you that you are stupid that you're an idiot that you're not smart enough
 That you're not good enough
 Then it causes them to feel as though they are more worthy. I know I know it doesn't make sense
 Guys we are in a fallen world
 We were born into this crap right?
 That's why there's a better life coming
 So that type of person that type of of negative person can constantly
 Add to your bad decision making
 If you're allowing those thoughts in if you're allowing that to that person to set your reality that you are dumb
 That you're not good enough that you're not smart. I can tell you I do what this a lot here
 I have a lot of folks that will come in
 Crud I have people on my team that will experience this right that they've had that know what all person who constantly treated them like an idiot
 And constantly treated them like they just weren't smart enough that they will make decisions to try and prove that they're not smart enough
 They will do bad things they will have bad decision making a lot of folks that come through next level of life a lot of folks that come through strappling
 will have these you know you can see their decision making is trying to prove that they're not smart enough
 The whole time they're focusing on again either proving that they are smart enough
 or affirming that the know what all is right
 That they're not and not seeing how badly they're damaging their own life how much they're damaging their future by making decisions
 that are absolutely self-sabotaging
 They're self-sabotaging them they're sabotaging their future their processes their their life their relationships
 Because they constantly feel as though they are not smart enough. Listen none of us are smart enough
 None of us are smart enough
 We think that we're intelligent guys the the gifts and talents that we have aren't ours they come from the Holy Spirit
 So listen focus on the things that he wants you to focus on
 Focus on though don't go and try and prove somebody right or prove him wrong
 Focus on him focus on God the more you do that the less you worry about one of not your smart enough
 The more you ask for his wisdom daily this is in my prayer
 You know, please give me your wisdom and knowledge to lead your children
 Daily I'm asking for that and
 Crazy thing God sure gives it to me. I'd love to say this is all my stuff
 But it's not it comes from him so that may be another negative person that you need to put some distance between okay
 So those are the first two of the eight negative people you should avoid we will learn more when we come back right after this
 Folks if you've been listening to me for any length of time
 Then you know the number one issue when it comes to business when it comes to family when it comes to friendships
 Is having a lack of high quality communication to make sure that you are absolutely winning in every aspect of your
 Life it all starts with having great
 Communication the best way to get that communication is to understand your personality style and to understand the personality style of the folks that you're spending the most time with
 Whether it be at work whether it be at home
 The best way to do that is to go to christecrittle.com/store and get your personality profile and personality profiles for your team
 Two day get it for your family members today as you go through that profile you will begin to see the greatest ways to communicate go to
 Chrissacrittle.com/store today
 next person the drama queen
 I do believe the old saying that misery loves company
 Is absolutely true some will go out of their way to stir up as much drama as possible and suck other people into it, right?
 Nintendo focus on folks whose heart cares for others and tends to be too big to consciously protect themselves
 You can see this all day long if you choose to if you if you're somebody who spends a lot of time on Facebook
 Oh my gosh
 I was so glad the day I realized that I could still have friends on Facebook but not follow their feed
 Because every now and then when I would go to flip through a feed or something you can see the drama queens
 You can see the folks that are throwing out the most ridiculous negative stuff and trying to draw people in
 And who are the people that respond guys if you literally if you go through your feed or and maybe you've done a great job of of getting these people out of there's well
 But anytime somebody's posting something
 To get other folks to comment and rescue
 There's your drama queen
 That's exactly what you're looking for you see it in your life you may be the rescue her
 You may not even realize how much you are affecting you negatively and enabling the drama queen
 Now why is somebody a drama queen because they're losing worth like crazy
 They're trying to find worth and so how do they do that?
 They will complain about the most ridiculous thing and
 Wait for all the people who respond oh honey. I'm so sorry that you're experiencing that today
 So your toast are broke down. I remember when that happened to my toaster what a horrible day that was oh for the love
 People are getting arms chopped off around this world
 People are getting their heads chopped off standing up for Christ
 And we're really complaining about some of the most ridiculous stuff on you know on the planet
 Well, why are they?
 Because again they're losing worth and they're trying to find a way to gain it
 How do they gain worth?
 By trying to convince you that you need to care for them that you need to rescue them that you need to
 Pour into them solve their problem all of that stuff
 Hey, rescue her
 Here's a problem
 Every time you do that you're enabling them to live that life
 So you're literally helping them to stay a victim
 You're helping them to make bad decisions like this do not do it
 Don't do it if you want to
 Comment on somebody who's acting this way comment like I just did
 Somebody is like coming to go and you're not gonna believe what just happened
 It's just been the worst day. Oh really. Why is that? I got up this morning my toast is broken
 I couldn't make my whatever toast or what are those pastries things?
 I couldn't do and then I had to rush out the door and so I've had like no breakfast whatsoever
 Just look at him and go
 I'm sorry
 Is there other options that you can do to take care of this could you get up earlier and maybe have time to make something else?
 They are not gonna like you. I can promise you this
 So expect it and this is very difficult for you rescuers
 But give them another option. Hey really is this really the response what if things I'll do the next level
 Life from time to time was I will look at a person and I will say hey let me ask you a question
 Is your response equal to the situation
 It doesn't take log for somebody to go oh my gosh. I am being a victim. I'm pretty
 Because really you just said this is the worst day and the reason why it's the worst days because you weren't able to do your
 Toaster stoodle whatever those things are is it really that bad?
 Is this really the worst day of your life or?
 Can you just get over yourself?
 So once again that type of drama the more you enable it the more it will come to you
 So the more you enable somebody to act that way expect them to continue to come to you
 Because they're looking for you to enable them again because they're losing work
 And they're trying to gain worth and they believe they've gotten worth from you enabling them so put some distance in there
 the fourth negative person that we probably want to put some distance between us and them is the taker
 This person is always interested in what you can do for them
 They are quite often a victim and always turning the focus back on themselves and what they are dealing with so if
 If you are struggling with something they will tend to tell you
 That it's not that big of a deal and you should see what they have been dealing with
 Do you know this person?
 Do you know the kind of person that might even take your situation and make it about them?
 That all of a sudden they're the problem like they're struggling and look at how bad things are for them
 This would be the taker and the taker is somebody who is always looking again
 It's it's like the drama queen, right?
 This is somebody who's looking to gain or not lose worth by switching a situation and making it about them
 And it's not even just about switching situations
 It may be that they're coming to you to see what you can do for them
 It may be you know there's a lot of folks a lot of times I've had to help hide these
 See that they can be takers because the moment they realize that a high S will be incredibly loyal and they can drive right over the top of them with a steamroller
 I've had to help them see hey, this is not good decision making you know you're taking from this person and once they see it
 Then you know obviously it's it's it's I got to stop doing that
 But there are folks who are really doing this because of worth
 Based in their worth and they take and take and take from other people and the focus is always on them
 It's not on the other person and they tend to be a victim in the process
 Look at what I'm going through look at how bad this situation is what can you do for me to help me?
 I used to have to help a lot of my high S is
 By saying hey listen when somebody comes to you and say hey, I've got this need
 Well, how does a high S respond? Oh, it's a need let me drop everything in my life and take care of you
 You know I this you're the only person who can help me with this
 Oh come on knock it off
 Sometimes you have to watch this and you have to see that somebody is taking from you it also happens and
 You know love relationships it happens in love it happens and all different types of ways in your life
 You can see it and family members
 You can see it in friendships if you've got that really dominant friend
 Who's always taking from you you're always the first person they call when they struggle with something
 But the one time you have a problem you turn to them and all of a sudden they just aren't too busy
 You're telling you just to get over it
 It's interesting well why would they do that because they actually don't like they hate the things
 In themselves that they hate now. There's right and so if they see you being somebody who needs in that moment
 Well you just need to get over
 You just need to get over. Oh well how about this last 17 times when I've helped you to try and get over something right?
 So again you have to recognize what the persons intentions are if they are not loveing if they're not trying to
 You know put you before themselves and I don't mean that in a submissive
 I'm gonna get run over type of way but in a healthy I can put you before myself and sometimes putting you before me means that I do not enable you
 Actually, you know give you a little knock upside the head with a two by four
 Sometimes that's important right?
 So the take or is another person that can constantly cause you to be giving of yourself and
 Empting of yourself if you're not strong enough to understand this then you will drain you and there won't be a whole lot left
 All right, this is going so much longer than we had scheduled for this so we're gonna break this up right now
