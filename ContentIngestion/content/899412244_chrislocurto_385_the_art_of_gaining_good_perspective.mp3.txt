 Welcome to the show folks.
 Joining me on the show today is Brian Alex.
 Welcome back to the show Brian.
 It's been a while. I'm happy to be here.
 It has been a while. What are we talking about today?
 We are talking about the art of gaining great perspectives.
 Why in the world? Let me gain some perspective.
 Demonstrate for us.
 Why in the world are we talking about that?
 Because I don't know some of these terms.
 And I've been here a year.
 You've been here. You hear us talk about this.
 You see it in action.
 Right.
 But there's times that you've done a great job of going,
 Hey, help me to understand it.
 Sometimes that I've done that.
 There are times.
 Because sometimes we talk.
 It's interspeak.
 We talk about it so much.
 But we decided because it's so good.
 You ask such great questions on how
 we'd understand what the thing is you're talking about.
 I'm learning to do that.
 You're learning to do that.
 That's it learned skill.
 It is all soon find out.
 It just it is. It is definitely a learned skill.
 So today we're talking about
 getting perspective or the art of gaining perspective.
 So here's the thing folks.
 Let's start by defining what perspective is.
 Now for me, what I say all the time.
 I say is, especially we do this as we're getting together with leaders.
 Let me explain to you what perspective gathering is.
 Or people through next to the line.
 If it just doesn't matter.
 Perspective merely means a point of view.
 Everybody has a point of view.
 Everybody has a perspective.
 But quality perspective is gaining all of the perspective that's available at the time.
 So for me, if you're going to gain quality perspective,
 it's finding out the other points of view that are available.
 I feel like we're gathering information.
 We're like, I don't know, an inspector or some kind of a detective
 and we're gathering clues before we use that information.
 So what you just said is one of the most,
 what I say is one of the most profound pieces to this is what's the point?
 The point is that when we make decisions based on just our perspective,
 that's all we've got.
 And what we tend to find out is there was more information that we could have used.
 We could have made better decisions. We could have made wiser decisions.
 And that's a big key.
 We're going to talk about that a little bit.
 We'll talk about what is it like to surround yourself with why's people or wisdom?
 So these are the things that we're going to be talking about when we come back right after this.
 [Music]
 Welcome to the Chris LaCardau Show,
 where we discuss leadership and life and discover that business is what you do,
 not who you are.
 [Music]
 Alright, we're back and reading Proverbs 4 5 through 7, it says this,
 "Get wisdom, get understanding.
 Don't forget or turn away from the words from my mouth.
 Don't abandon wisdom and she will watch over you.
 Love her and she will guard you.
 Wisdom is supreme. So get wisdom and whatever else you get, get understanding."
 So we are talking about that today.
 As we went into the break, I was talking about what is it like to surround yourself with.
 Why is people?
 I think we struggle so much in this world to have the right answers to not sound stupid,
 to be smart, to want to look smart, sound intellectual.
 And there's so many times we're not seeking out wisdom.
 We're not looking to people who are further down the road from us or have more information.
 And obviously the folks listening to this show, you guys are listening to the show because you're seeking wisdom.
 But in the perspective gathering world, I don't know if they say world,
 world process, whatever.
 Microverses.
 The microverses, those of us that actually do care, you have a need to gain more wisdom.
 Well, I would also say, we don't know our own deficits.
 We don't know our own blind spots.
 And so I think a lot of us, maturing and coming to better perspective on ourselves and being more self aware is understanding our own limitations by the experiences we've had.
 And our personality and how these create gaps in our understanding that we're not always aware of.
 And so what we're learning here and what I've been learning over the last year is the art of asking great questions because I'm starting to understand.
 I don't know it all.
 That's really tough for me to process.
 Why is that tough, Brian?
 Why don't know?
 Do we have to get into that way?
 But no, it's too much.
 Next level I've run here.
 Why do you struggle with that?
 Is it control?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 I didn't see that.
 But seriously, why do you struggle?
 Like so, like I was sharing on the wisdom side.
 So many people.
 Now, the great thing is that people that are coming to us, they want wisdom, they want growth.
 They're very rarely.
 Once in a great while, we'll have that person who knows everything and doesn't want to receive any information.
 And everything's falling apart.
 Right?
 I'm not falling apart.
 The life is falling apart.
 But they're right about everything.
 So that's the rare occurrence.
 Everybody who's coming to see us for the most part is I don't know what I don't know or I need to know why I'm not making the right decision or or.
 How many times is that struggle?
 The I want to have the right answer.
 I want to be right.
 I don't want to be wrong.
 I don't want to, you know, I'm not going to look for more perspective because I need to be right.
 How?
 Like, what is that experience for you?
 Well, it reminds me of something you said in a Strat plan not long ago.
 You were talking to the team that was in about how most of the time our communication is about us offering our own opinions and our own perspective and just making statements.
 Right?
 But we're not trying to gain any information before coming to a judgment or before coming to a decision on something or before laying actions and plans down to act on.
 And so we we limit ourselves so much because we think and I don't know I'm inside my own head here, but we think okay I've already got a good perspective but as we'll find out in the money and my perspective is the right one reading it.
 Well, that's personality.
 We'll get to that in a minute, too, but reading a little bit of head also from Proverbs a full takes no pleasure in understanding but only in expressing his opinion.
 Ouch.
 So powerful. So powerful. One of the things that I will ask people during a Strat plan and this ruins it for people that are coming into.
 As we're talking through stuff like you just mentioned, you may have seen me talk about I usually have a coffee thermos a big stainless steel coffee thermos on the table at the time.
 And I will.
 That's a question. That is a great question.
 It's all. That is a free.
 Anybody come in for Strat plan.
 That is the right question.
 Boom. That's the question.
 Because I'm at the end of the table.
 We're all around the table.
 You know, it can be two three liters to up to ten liters.
 It just depends on how many people come in from the business.
 And I'll ask the question is we're walking through this and people are making statements and giving opinions.
 I'll say hey, what colors this thermos? And every time I go silver.
 And then I'll say what if I said it was blue?
 And probably 75% of the time somebody will go, I'd say you're stupid because it's obviously silver.
 Obviously it's silver.
 And then I say my point.
 That I say if I turned it around and my side was my side was blue.
 What would you think? And everybody goes that I didn't get enough perspective didn't have the whole picture.
 That's exactly it. And I think that's the big key is when we're talking about this.
 And I know you've got a bunch of great questions that you ask.
 You always have phenomenal questions of gaining perspective for understanding.
 As we talk about this, the key is not.
 I'm right with my answer.
 The key is not.
 I can see it silver.
 And if I say it's blue, the next thing that should happen is I think Chris is a little crazy.
 I'm looking at the thing, it's silver.
 I see that it's silver.
 I'm struggling with this.
 I want to say, Chris you're a lunatic because it's obviously silver
 and holding all of that back and going, hey, help me to understand how you see it as being blue.
 Show me why you think it's blue.
 And gaining further perspective. And so this is one of the things we teach leaders all the time
 is or even parents. We teach parents to say even if you know the answer.
 And you're struggling with your child.
 You're in debate with that child.
 Still keep gaining perspective to find out why do you think that's the answer?
 Because you may hear a perspective that makes you go, ah.
 Now I can understand why you're thinking that way.
 You're still wrong.
 But let's not do that. But now I can see why you think that way.
 Let me speak to it from my perspective and let's kind of, you know, get to a great
 wise answer at the end of this.
 It feels like we don't come out of the womb so narrow-minded.
 We're asking all the white questions at 3 to 5 and then after that, got it.
 We've got all the information done.
 I've been on the planet six years. I've learned to talk and walk.
 Therefore I am.
 What if it's because when we learn why the sky is blue from our parents?
 And then we find out from a teacher the answer is wrong.
 He's saying it.
 I was.
 How about parents a road?
 I think what we're learning.
 What I'm seeing, what I'm hearing you say is we have a very narrow field of vision
 that if we want to succeed in life and business and everything that's what we teach
 here on the show, we have to open up that field of vision and bring in and learn to be
 curators or gatherers of information.
 I mean, this whole perspective gathering thing is a critical thinking process that we
 have to learn how to do, but to do that, we've got to get past ourselves and be
 able to learn to ask questions, which means somebody may think, oh, you don't know that.
 Already, you know, and that may put us in a bad light.
 So we have to have a little bit of humility, I think.
 Yeah, let me so I agree with what you're saying on the narrow view, but let me say it
 a different way.
 We have only our view.
 So there are some people who have a wide view in our still missing lots of information.
 Right? It's we have the view that we have because of the experiences that we've experienced,
 because of the things that we've been taught, because of the personality style that we have,
 the way that we give information and receive information, the way that we act and react,
 all of those things build our perspective.
 And so even if the thing is right dead in front of us, we're only seeing 25% of the picture.
 But it feels complete.
 It feels complete because we know all of the things that we know.
 We know our experiences.
 We know our past.
 We know what's happened when this has happened to us before.
 We know how people have reacted when we said this thing.
 We know that when we look at it, it looks like those are the pieces that even if you are the most
 learned person, you're still stuck at that place.
 And what we tend to believe is if I'm the smartest person in the room, which you should never be thinking.
 That because it's, it has no, it doesn't, what do you base it on?
 How am I smarter?
 Well, if somebody has more information on something else that I don't have, how does that make me smarter than them?
 Right?
 It just means I'm smarter on the things that I know that they don't.
 Maybe you need new friends.
 You probably maybe want to learn.
 Yeah.
 If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the room.
 Yes.
 Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. That's so funny. I was, it really John Maxwell probably 15 years ago.
 We were talking about that. It's like if you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room.
 Get in a different room where you're not.
 Right?
 So that you can gain and grow.
 But let's say you are the smartest person in the room.
 It doesn't change the fact that somebody's got a different perspective than you got.
 Right?
 The two can grow from learning somebody else's perspective.
 And our big fear is, is that I have to be right.
 I have to know this thing.
 I already have the answer.
 There's no point in debating this so that I don't.
 Then I don't spend time learning somebody else's perspective.
 And we'll probably get into this in a minute about where this intersects with the the disc and personality styles.
 But I think maybe some of the fear that I have is if I give up my perspective.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's a good idea.
 And I think that's what so many people do believe.
 They believe that if I gain perspective from you, if I if I learn what you think about this,
 then I'm giving up my own perspective, there's no giving up perspective.
 What if your perspective is wrong?
 Do you not want right perspective?
 Do you know what greater information?
 That is a great question.
 I don't you want to grow.
 So there may be a point where you want to discard the information that you have because it's not accurate.
 It's not right.
 It's not good.
 Whatever.
 But it doesn't mean that you have to.
 Right.
 So if I see that the canister is silver for my point of view and you say it's blue for your point of view,
 then I don't give up my perspective.
 My perspective says it's silver.
 Right.
 I just need to move over to your side and find out why you think it's blue.
 Look at it from the other person's point of view.
 That's exactly it.
 If I'm looking at a discussion and let's say we're arguing with a spouse about something or a child,
 I think this is probably even a better version.
 As an adult, you have all of these experiences in life and you're arguing with your child about why they shouldn't hang out with a specific friend or something like that.
 Right.
 I don't know.
 I'm just spitballing here.
 And you're talking about how this person is making that choice. This is this. And then if you stop there, then you don't understand why your child wants to hang out with that friend.
 You're just telling them you're not doing it. I'm smarter than you.
 I'm the adult here.
 I'm your authority.
