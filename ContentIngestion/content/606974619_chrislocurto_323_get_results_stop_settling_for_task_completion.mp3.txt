 Is your leadership as healthy as you think it is?
 That is coming up next.
 Welcome to the Crystal Acredo Show,
 where we discuss leadership and life
 and discover that business is what you do, not who you are.
 Welcome to the show folks.
 Today I am going to tell you a story about Steve.
 But instead of a big version,
 big picture version of a story, I'm going to give you a look at it as daily life.
 I'm going to, I'm doing this because after coaching leaders for decades,
 I know how story resonates with most leaders.
 So here we go.
 So it's 6 a.m. the alarm goes off and Steve hits news.
 Nine minutes later, it screeches again and he shuts it off and rolls out of bed.
 Steve stumbles toward the shower and starts getting ready for his day.
 As he's getting ready, he's reminded of the pressure he feels in his chest.
 His mind also raises toward everything he has to get done today.
 It's now 7.30 a.m. and Steve is driving to work.
 He's thinking through the day schedule.
 The task that he has to do that he knows aren't his strengths.
 They weigh on him. The three meetings he is leading add to that anxiety.
 He wants to make his team happy and for them to have confidence in his leadership.
 It's now 8 a.m.
 Steve walks into work and he puts on a big smile, shakes hands and asks everyone how they're
 evening was. Then he sees Shelley. He immediately feels guilty because he knows she is still
 waiting on something from him for the project. She's working on and then it's Tim. There's been
 underperforming for a while now. The entire team sees it but Steve can't pull himself to make that
 hard decision. It's now 9 a.m. and Steve goes to lead his first meeting. He knows he hasn't
 followed prepared for it. There just isn't enough time but he knows how important this meeting is
 because it has the potential to really drive the outcomes that they need.
 934 Steve's wife texts him. He feels that familiar guilt knowing she's frustrated because he keeps
 saying yes to too much and is overwhelmed with work. He reshifts his focus back to the meeting.
 10.05 and Steve leaves the meeting and went fine. He didn't get the most out of it but
 didn't think it totally flopped either. Steve then goes and settles into his desk and to lunch
 to do the task he's been putting off. The ones that take longer than he thinks they should.
 It's now 1 p.m. and Steve leads his second meeting of the day. It goes great. He walks out
 feeling confident like he could never fail. He then makes a few calls to encourage team members and
 touch base with a vendor. Now it's 3 p.m. and Steve's third meeting is underway.
 A disgruntled employee speaks up. shares with the team how he feels the process is being used
 to our highly dysfunctional and making his job very difficult. Another employee pipes up in agreement.
 Steve's heart that was just on cloud 9 sinks fast. He knows he just lost the room.
 He feels the pressure of his team is unhappiness. He's overwhelmed with the thought of everything
 that needs to be changed to get things where they need to be. He starts questioning his leadership
 ability. He feels unqualified and feels like his team is watching him fail and they're starting to doubt
 his leadership. So he works until 630 p.m. trying to make up ground and show his team how dedicated he
 is. His wife texts at 625 asking when you're coming home. The guilt rushes back and piles on
 what the anxiety and overwhelm. Folks, here's what I want you to know. Steve is an actual person
 and he's given us the okay to walk through this process. Now we've changed his name. It's not actually
 Steve. But Steve, while he is a real person, he is also in fact a lot of the leaders that we coach.
 So on this episode, we're going to be talking more about Steve and what healthy leadership looks like.
 But before we dig deeper into his story, I want to tell you about our next level leadership
 live event. Now it only happens once a year and tomorrow is the last day to get your tickets.
 I've never seen a leader that's had everything that they wanted. Out of thousands of leaders that I've
 coached most are probably a lot like you. You wish you saw greater productivity and less drama from your
 team that you didn't spend your energy putting out fires that you had more time to invest in your family
 and the things that you enjoy and you felt more equipped to lead your team to success. The only thing
 that's holding leaders back from the results they desire is having the right tools and you can get those
 tools at the next level leadership live event. So if you're young, old, new, experienced,
 struggling or really successful, this event is for anyone who is ready to learn from 25 years of best
 practices that get proven results. It's not about short-term fixes. In three days, I'm going to teach
 you how to have sustained revenue growth to generate greater productivity from your team and get immediate
 momentum toward the results that you want. It's going to be detailed, practical and loaded with how tos.

 christacrilo.com/events and get your tell to this event and invest in your leadership and your
 business that's christacrilo.com/events. I can't wait to see you there. We are talking about Steven.
 You may hear Steve's day and think "ouch." Man, that is rough. He needs leadership coaching.
 Or you could hear it and think "wow, that's me. Here's the thing. I know Steve personally. He's a
 fantastic leader. Amazing leader, but when he walked into our program, he was like most of our
 other clients and believed that he was the only one who had these struggles. It is a fantastic thing
 whenever we bring on a new group into our next level of mastermind and they come to their very
 first retreat. I will usually ask a question and say how many all feel like you're the only ones to go
 through this and the brand new peeps raise their hands in the veterans laugh because they've all been there.
 We always think that we're the only ones going through this stuff. That we're the only listen. The
 reason why I teach this stuff is because I used to be a Steve. I used to experience that kind of
 stuff early on in my leadership career. The stuff that you learn from me are from failures. It's from the
 stuff that I've learned over decades of growing, learning, teaching and leading people. But you're not
 alone. If you're experiencing this and you're going "man, that sounds a lot like me,
 well, I guess what? There are a ton of other people listening to this that feel the same way."
 Let's dig into his story more and I can't wait to tell you about his transformation.
 So you heard some of his struggles stressed out saying yes to many things. The strain on his marriage,
 bogged down and tasked that aren't even in his strengths. The anxiety that comes when he needs to hit
 the outcomes, the worry that it has about his team not believing in him as a leader. So much of this
 came from his root system and he had literally no idea. So if you haven't heard us talk about root
 system, go back and listen to the understanding your root system podcast, the episode and we're going
 to put a link in the show notes and all that kind of stuff, then you'll get so much more out of this
 episode. So, Steve's root system. Now, the surface level response is that Steve was experiencing
 what's feeling responsible for other people was people pleasing. So if you haven't seen this another
 people or you haven't seen it in yourself, then here's kind of how people pleasing can show up.
 You feel the need to praise to feel good. You might praise other people so that you feel better about
 yourself. You feel uncomfortable if somebody's angry at you. You might feel like a crazy loss of
 worth if somebody feels angry or somebody even if somebody appears to be mad at you. You're probably
 losing a good amount of worth in the process. You're assuming a whole ton of stuff. You're assuming
 that people are mad. You're assuming Steve did that. People think your leadership sucks. All of these
 assumptions that flow in. You say yes to way too many things. Way too many things. What do you say yes?
 Because it's pleasing people. I want to help this person. I want to take care of this person. So I'm
 going to say yes to this thing. Even though I just said yes to seven other things and they all have
 to be accomplished in the same time frame. You feel burdened by the things that you have to do. Now
 in Steve's words, these are Steve's own words. It was very much a burden that I put on myself. I felt
 I had to make other people happy or that it was my responsibility. It's shaped a lot of areas in my life.
 It's just not healthy. How much energy I invest in trying to do that. I can't say it was a
 conscious thing but it was something that would really weigh on me. I created a lot of stress in my life.
 So those are Steve's own words. If you ever experience that, if you know if you were letting to that
 right now and I don't know anybody who's listening to this that doesn't relate to at least one piece
 in that. And a lot of people relate to the whole thing. Those are the experiences that he was putting
 on himself. He was taking on way too much and having really poor boundaries, not being able to say no.
 If you haven't heard the statement every time you say yes to something, you're saying no to something
 else. You have a limited amount of time in the day. So every time you take on something else in an attempt
 to people please, every time you take on something in an attempt to in your mind convince yourself that you're
 helping somebody else, then you're saying no to something else. As we talked about in Steve's
 end of the day he's saying no to being home with his family. I'm not saying that you can't work
 late. I'm not saying that you know that you have to, I'm never going to be the person who works for
 hours a week. I don't even believe in that. I believe you do the work that you're called to do. But
 when it's affecting your marriage, that's not good right? So you need to have quality, healthy
 boundaries. And what poor boundaries looks like is relationships that are difficult or dramatic.
 You've seen that you've experienced that. You find that decision making can be a challenge.
 Right? Because what decision do you make? Do you make a decision that hurts somebody? Do you make a decision
 that puts somebody at the back of a line? Do you make a decision that may wear you out and cause you to be
 overwhelmed? So decision making can be challenging. You find that you have guilt and anxiety.
 And you find that you're tired for what appears to be no reason. Again, Steve's words are
 a high-di personality. My wife is a 99SNC. So obviously talking about personality profiles
 folks. If you've not done disc with your team, get it done. Polar opposites. My need to just do
 things that other people ask to make other people happy. Create a lot of stress in our relationship.
 I had to say in quotes, yes, to everything. So Steve's aha moment after realizing all this
 experience in this was after two days of getting perspective and walking through his next level of life.
 There was a breakthrough. Now, I can barely scratch the surface on this podcast, but here are two
 high-level takeaways that started to change him in changes leadership for the better. The first thing
 was knowing how much self-worth was impacting his daily life in leadership. He finally saw how much self-worth
 he was getting by being productive in any given moment. The productivity was feeding his worth. And that
 was that leadership wall that he kept hitting. Never seen it. That productivity is not your worth.
 Now, it's your work to the business, right? But when we are getting our worth from productivity,
 we're not even efficient. We're not even necessarily doing the right things. The key thing that he saw
 there was that productivity was feeding so much of his worth. And he didn't want his daughter to grow up
 believing the same thing. Literally again in his words, after going through next level of life,
 here's how I described it. Now, I feel comfortable with where I'm getting myself worth. I know
 quickly now if I'm out of line and if I just need to read a just. That was a big, powerful piece.
 The other piece was being able to focus on his strengths. Again, in his words, it's a lot easier
 for me to embrace what I do well and not get trapped in the things that I don't do well, which has been
 the previous years. The last four years before my events allowed me to focus on more of my strengths.
 Rather than some of the things that just don't come easily to me. So let's take a look at Steve's
 life now, specifically when it comes to his leadership and at work. And again, I'm just going to
 read you what he says. It's amazing. Once the curtains pulled back on that, we really dig a lot deeper with
 my team members and understand each other. Oh, powerful. I'm able to share what I struggle with
 so much easier because I know that makes a big difference in how open we can be with each other
 and where we can get as a team. The big thing that I think helps me as a leader is so much of it comes
 back to understanding myself. It's so important for me and for really anyone to understand who they are.
 I'm able to engage others. It's changed every aspect of how I lead. There's just this openness
 and comfort with me and with others that is just so different than before. Powerful. Powerful
 stuff that he's experienced since coming through his next level of life, how it's affected his leadership
 because Steve invested himself, his marriage is stronger. His daughter is going to grow up, not believing
 that a worth comes from productivity, not believing that a worth comes from people pleasing. His team
 unified, but I know I've seen the unified team. It's gone to a completely different level of communication
 is immensely improved. Now that he's not focused on pleasing everyone else, he can actually laser focus
 on the most productive and important work as a clear mind. He's got vision of his strengths and the
 tools for when he gets off course or out of line as he phrased it to be able to pull himself back into
 this place of not seeking worth in the wrong places, not feeling like he's worthless, not feeling like he's
 a failure, not making all the assumptions that his team thinks it is not good. So here's my question.
 What would the healthier version of your leadership and your life look like? What new outcomes
 would you see? This is not an injection of motivation or a series of life hacks to last you a few weeks
 and there's a lot of people out there selling stuff that gets you motivated for a few weeks and then
 you're back to the same spot. It's a personal plan for your strongest life and goes deep into the
 why to create real lasting results in freedom. So if you want to learn what the healthiest version of
 yourself and your leadership looks like, if you want to change your family tree, if you want to change
 the way that you feel the assumptions you create, the overwhelm that you have by not being able to say no,
 by saying yes to many times, then go to christlacurne.com/discover so that you can learn more and take the next
