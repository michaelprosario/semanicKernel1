 How to lead up influence and create change when you're not the one in charge. That's coming up next.
 Welcome to the Chris LaCardo Show where we discuss leadership and life and
 Discover that business is what you do not who you are
 Well, welcome back everyone to the Chris LaCardo Show. This is once again not Chris LaCardo. This is Joel Fortner on Chris's team
 So glad to be back with you and Brian so glad to be back with you as always my
 Alustrius friend and it'll I've missed you and I've missed hearing
 Alustrius I am I still have not figured out in what way anyone would find me as
 Alustrius, but I'm glad that you do I'm searching for it as well. I thought if I just keep saying it I'll eventually find it
 If we've done it those new one. Yeah, okay, I get exactly. Yeah, yeah, you were like a baseball field in a cornfield
 Field of dreams right here my friend. Yeah, absolutely
 But enough about us
 What's talking about everybody else?
 What do you think about us that's great. That's great. I think we're great Brian all right well
 So guys on today show we're talking about what's really a very difficult topic
 I'm very challenging topic for many leaders. That's this whole idea of leading up or influencing a leader in your life
 You may be a leader
 You may be you may be the one who's being led at home and you know, it's like oh, yeah
 That's about definitely not a true mob John the influence my leader at home or whatever maybe
 But it's how do we it's we're talking about how do we do that? Well
 I mean primarily we're talking about the business organizational context today
 but this can be such a challenge for so many leaders
 When you're not on the same page and you don't share the same maybe the same values or or even morals or beliefs about
 How leadership should go or you don't you don't you maybe you have differences of opinion of what the priorities of the company should be or the or
 Whatever it may be it's where we have the gaps is where the problem is really present from self
 Yeah, and I'd love to see if we can tease out a little bit of you know your relationship with Chris
 They're at you know since Chris it doesn't find himself on the show today. Let's let's just have a go with this
 Let's talk about them and
 Hopefully I don't know if he listens to his own podcast probably doesn't have to because he's on it 90-5% of the time
 But that said you're in you know
 You're in a role now over the last year as as the president new title and then Chris is still the CEO and all of that so
 You know, I'd love to see where that kind of rub you guys have worked together so long now
 You can almost finish each other sentences and you pretty much know where Chris's mind is going to go about anything
 But I imagine there's still times where you have a different perspective or you know a different
 Way of approaching things than Chris and Chris needs that and I know that he's open and
 Receptive to gaining perspective but not everybody finds themselves in that kind of a of a situation and so yeah
 I'm looking forward to kind of teasing some of that out today, but you know
 Just to kind of set the stage you're probably familiar with the phrase
 It's a lonely at the top talking about leadership and that's because there are very few
 Organizationally who can be in that you know leadership the the main leader of an organization
 In that position and so most people probably find themselves
 Under another leader even if you are at the top you still have other people hopefully speaking into your lives for
 Accountability for you know perspective gaining for you know mastermind groups all of that kind of thing that happens and so
 You know
 Whether or not you're that top spot doesn't really matter today
 What we're talking about is being a positive influence and I want to say you know
 I think I want to underline that just for a second that when we're talking about influencing others
 It's not to manipulate them to do what you think needs to happen
 Right, oh, I thought that we're gonna talk about that. We're gonna teach you
 Sorry, this is gonna be on the show anymore
 All right well jol's off so let's just talk about it. Just no but right
 I mean, but we got we got to we got to point that out. I mean that that's probably obvious to you know
 Most of the listeners, but we need to underline that we're not just influencing in order to have our way
 Correct, we're trying to be
 a positive influence on the leader in our life fill in the gaps be supportive
 Add value to the to the organization and positively
 Propel the culture forward towards the vision and the mission of the organization
 That's what we're talking within those confines. I think all of that is
 It needs to be said though, right? Okay, so yeah, because it weren't here right you're we're not talking about your selfish desires
 We're not so to take a kind of go back a little bit
 You know as people we can struggle with control
 And it's easy to sit in a leader's ships spot at times and be like oh yeah jol and Brian
 I know you're talking about I work for a leader that's super difficult and I don't agree with them and
 They make bad calls and you say it's you know you have to be careful standing back in judgment
 And this is where you do have to gain perspective and you have to also look inside yourself and be like a gosh
 Am I being judgmental am I being controlling in terms of well my opinion is better
 My perspective is better. I'm a better leader. I make better judgment calls. I would have handled those people differently in that
 - our relationship - kind of that you know and you can sit back and struggle with control or self-righteousness or pride and
 We have those are costumes. We're not talking about a lot of that today, but we have to be cautious with our view of who our other leader is
 That we have to approach it with great health
 And we have to acknowledge we may be off about some stuff or we may make making some assumptions about what our leader that leader is doing
 That we may or may not be right and so that's where we've got to really go after more quality communication
 So just before we get any farther down the tracks here
 I just want to speak into that and bring that into the light. First of all, we really have to operate with self-awareness
 Yeah, I think it's worth saying it's a great disclaimer here
 We have to approach it as you said healthily and with humility
 to understand hey look you know leaders are people too they are imperfect they're fallible
 Limited and they're emotional creatures just like we are they are they are like us we are like them and
 you're you're never going to be able to change your leader
 That is not your role and I mean if you know we we we can talk about that also in a marriage context
 We're never going to be able to change our partner our partner can choose to change
 But we can't do that for them what we can do is bring a level of influence and that's leadership
 We're going to be able to
 Supplement some things and find ways to be supportive but you know again
 They're imperfect we're imperfect and so where do we fit into all of that I guess that's kind of the discussion today
 I mean everybody finds themselves in an unfavorable situation at from time to time with the people that they
 They work with probably right now most people are thinking about oh yeah I know that leader and
 You know it doesn't matter if you you love your leader or get along perfectly with them
 Or there's you know rough edges to to sort out the problem is I think and correct me
 You know if you see it a different way the problem is is that we're not accustomed to thinking about
 Helping the people who are over us in leadership
 Most of the time
 You know
 If we're a leader we're thinking you know our focus is how do and and Chris says this all the time how do I make my team successful?
 Yeah, right how do I set them up for success make them
 Successful and in fact it can it can almost be to where we we kind of shrug off the idea of influencing the people above us or even on a colleague level of peer level
 Saying well, that's just not my job. I you know that's their
 Problem but you know John Maxwell would remind us that leadership is more
 Disposition than position it's influencing others from wherever you are in that sphere
 You know he talks about that in a book he wrote long time ago three hundred six a degree leader
 Leadership isn't always top down. It's exerting that positive influence all around you for the greater good and that includes
 The people that are over us, but I think that we we forget we're just not accustomed to seeing it that way are doing that
 Yeah, I think I think there's a lot of truth in that for some people
 You know, it's like one of the things I appreciate about our culture is that
 Chris is taught us long ago in our culture that
 You know and because he's not we're not shy about talking about stuff like this about hey
 You know that you know Heather and I are the business owners and
 With that comes a hey take care of us also as the owners. Let me be very clear about what I'm saying
 This is an honor or thing. This is a respect thing. This is a
 There are two of my best friends, but they choose to allow me to work on this team
 They're the business owners. They own this thing now. Is that I mean are but are we here?
 It's because it's all about Chris and Heather look her. Oh no, it's not this is about God and this is about the team
 Serving who's most important who is our clients and also the people that follow this show
 That we're trying to influence in a positive way so this is such a we thing
 But there is an honor and a respect that I will carry even as a best friend to Chris and Heather that they are also
 My leaders and they own the point main group and I think for me
 I think I have an unfair advantage Brian because when I you know I think and I think you may you can relate to this
 That even though we served in very different military capacities
 Like I can speak for myself and know I had a healthy respect that I was reporting to people who were quote-unquote above me
 I have no problem with that relationship. I was taught take care of your leader
 Take care of the commander take care of that Colonel take care of that general take care of that secretary
 Who I'm talking about like secretary of the air force working in the Pentagon environment
 That was just in me in my culture for so long
 And I think even in my family though, you know that my mom was a very
 Visual as a very strong and dominant personality and leader that it was like a okay mom was the more vocal of of all of our of the leadership in the home
 Dad was very high S and C mom was very high D high I more extroverted dominant and would be like this is what we're doing
 And this is where we're going and so I think my whole life that's why I think I have an unfair advantage
 I think people that don't have our an accustomed to this
 Are that can find it more difficult to kind of where do I fit in and how do I adopt this mindset of taking care of who I'm actually
 Reporting to or who's in charge or who's over me however we want to term this
 But I'll tell you that it's a worthy pursuit because if you want to go farther and influence in your organization
 Treat your leader like your customer
 You that I'm not talking about you have to be married to them. We're not talking about we've got to agree
 And we've got to be you know have find great level of marriage like unity every day it work
 I'm talking about man meet them where they're at try to find where you have common ground try to find
 What do they care about what are their priorities? What's on their agenda?
 How can you help them get those things done?
 If you will adopt that mindset and find success in that you will go farther in your career
 Yeah, and I imagine some of what complicates this for some people out there. I mean it
 You know, I'm just thinking about like gravity for example, you know lifting up is harder than pushing down
 And you know from a positional leadership standpoint. It's really easy in in some sense and and to do it poorly
 To manage or lead from that position and expect people under you to do
 What you say but when we think about leading up we're going against the grain a little bit in in what you know a lot of
 Companies are set up to do and and so that's one thing. It's a little bit against the grain where we're unacustomed
 Thinking that way just like you're saying and I think that is an unfair advantage
 But it's a mindset we should probably adopt but then you know to make matters worse
 It can be further complicated when that leader is insecure when they're immature
 When you know they're leading from that positional standpoint instead of a servant leader
 I mean it makes it complicates this whole thing to where I mean gosh the you know the objective would be
 I need to find ways to support at value
 Encourage them in the right direction towards the culture that we're trying to create as leaders
 In the the mission and the vision and the values that we've established that's the direction
 That we're trying to push things but you know if I don't know my leaders personality style
 I'm gonna further complicate things and it's a huge advantage when we learn how to both communicate and relate to and do things
 In a way that leans into their style of either personality or leadership
 I mean that's one way that we start to get an advantage or our heads wrapped around the situation
 That can really be complicated. Yeah, you bring up a lot of really good points. I mean this this whole idea can be very difficult
 When you've got say a difficult leader
 Let's just assume you know forsake a conversation that you're a leader guys and you're the you're say you're the health
 You're what let's just say that and you report to a more insecure image or or just more toxic leader
 It's like shoot how do I navigate that you know what it's gonna be hard it just is there's no like
 Oh, it's waving a magic wand and making this perfect you know that but this is why we also coach and train leaders at the
 At the CEO president, you know senior VP level to become phenomenal leaders
 Because it has everything to do with retention and has everything to do with not losing you healthy leader who's listening to this right now
 So there's only so much you can do here but do it find where that person's like you know what all the stuff
 For ice me crazy you know what you may not make it long term in the organization your end because your leader is just
 Too difficult. They're too unhealthy. You know that is just what it is and that's unfortunate if you're in that situation
 But as you said Brian it's like you can't change your leader what you can do is influence. I'll tell you
 It's like I'm 44 years old now and I feel like I'm finally getting to a place in life
 where I have
 enough life experience
 to look back and say what are some real truths here that like hold out
 But I'm starting to get enough gray where I can say stuff to be like hey
 This is a thing you should do and I'm very very certain about it
 It's like I'm now entering into that like it to phase in my life and
 So this is one of those things like I have done it enough in my own career in my own life
 I've seen and I've coached others and seen them do it as well
 That if you can empty yourself of a little bit more of yourself
 And be like you know what I don't like this stuff. I don't like this leader. I don't really but it's a you know what
 I've got to take care of them in the best ways that I can
 I've got to find common ground. I've got to look for where can I build a greater trust and rapport
 Other things that they don't like about me that I need to be like hey
 That ain't open the door on fun. Like how can I better serve you? How can I better you know lead you know help you
 How can I better align with what matters to you and your priorities and where you're trying to take stuff and you're just your
 Grappin for just stuff on where you can actually connect so there was something there was a guy
 I find myself talking about him all the time
 But when I was in college there was a guy named Joe Martin and he's a motivational speaker and he's the first guy
 He introduced me to this whole concept called purpose in life and it lit me up like I remember how excited
 I was about this whole idea and like you could see the good work of God back there in terms of like what we do in this business today
 Like on the next-level life side and
 Anyways, this whole idea lit me up. Well, he taught he also really targeted and helped teachers and he helped students be successful
 And one of the tricks of the grade has he called it. I think he has a book on this as he said on day one
 Day one of your class
 You'd be the student that goes to your professor
 You stick out your hand you introduce yourself and you strike up a conversation
 He says why is that so important because most students will listen and they will walk right by the professor and walk right out the door
 Moving on to the next class you will stand out
 But if you so take that idea and extrapolate it if you do all kinds of stuff like that
 to build trust and rapport with that quote-unquote professor in this case insert your leader into that
 What difference might that make if you put yourself out there in that kind of a way?
 Might you lead a one that has a better relationship with that difficult leader and actually it may go easier for you
 You may get your priorities moved forward. You may get your agenda. You may get their ear more
 And everybody else is like man. I don't know how you're doing that. I don't know how because you're practicing
 The tricks are the great types of examples. Yeah, I love that we're getting into some of the practical
 side of this because that was going to be my next question. How does all this get fleshed out in the in the workplace?
 And I love that we're teasing out what is the wrong motivation or mindset to bring to the situation when it comes to influencing
 Leaders and what is the right motivation and the mindset and I think you just answered part of this for us
 If somebody finds himself under a leader who either doesn't want their input
 Doesn't you know solicit their their perspective on things
 Being that one who presents themselves in a positive way hey, you know, how is your weekend and you know
 How's it going for you? Okay great. What do you need extra today? What can I do? I mean in their their volunteering
 above the the norm there's that standout feature that if I were the leader in that
 Position I would be looking for people on my team like that that I could go hey, you know what let me ask you a question
 What did you think about this situation over here? How could we have done this veteran and and as a leader my
 Guard starts to go down a little bit even if I'm that you know the emmator or the insecure leader
 I begin to feel that rapport growing that this person is here to serve me as a leader and the organization where we're going
 And they're not going to you know do something purposefully to jeopardize that or you know
 Get us off course. So I I'm gonna begin opening up as a leader. I think that's one of the ways the positive influence it
 Maybe you find yourself there in in the leaders that are around you there are some steps
 Measures you can take to present yourself
 You know, especially if you're frustrated with the leader over you right now
 There are some things that you can control again. You can't change your leader, but you can change your response
 You can change how you
 the the rapport that you have with them that is absolutely within your control and not that we want to end up being a suck up or you know
 Somebody who's just you know, I'm going to run like a puppy dog. Yeah. Yeah. We're not talking about being a suck up or being a people
 pleaser, you know, we're saying so I was listening to this podcast the other day and I heard this story and
 this person I forget what she does exactly but she said in her career
 that she was serving this client and it was a very very difficult client and it was one of those clients that would email her
 And what she did in order to cope was that she would then gossip and judge that that client
 to her co-worker and be like oh my gosh Brian like here's so and so and she's all my gosh here she is again and here's all this stuff
 near us how she's being and then she would actually type up the response that she wanted to send
 to the client that she had sized up is this super difficult kind of toxic person. So she typed up her
 response and then she'd always delete it. Well guess what you see where this is going
 she sent it she sent the replies to the client and then she was like I mean all of a sudden all the
 fear and stress hit her she goes to her boss and says hey this is what I just did and her boss said
 you have to go apologize and she was like oh my gosh cannot just please be fired cannot just be
 fired instead so if you shut you have to go apologize. So she goes and buys the huge bouquet of
 flowers shows up with his bouquet of flowers and hat and hand goes into this client's office the first thing
 the client said when the client looked at her was the client said why didn't you just tell me
 why didn't you just tell me so where am I going with this we size people up you may think oh I know
 my difficult leader I know I'm inside and out don't be so prideful you may be wrong you may be wrong about
 some stuff or misjudging their character or because you've sized them up and you just what if you decided
 to do I'm not going to share with you anything but I'm not ever going to attempt to give them any
 feedback on how I experience them that would go horribly I already know what's going to happen you're
 making assumptions now already know how difficult this is this is high conflict zone we're in right now
 this is fear inducing it stress inducing my point is there's always more options that you may think
 are available to you because go to the back to the story what if she had discussed with the client and
 say hey I'm so sorry I just need to talk a few about some things because there's just some things
 I'm really struggling with in our relationship and I don't want this to be confrontational but I just
 want to I want to do a good job for you and I'm just finding myself struggling can we just talk about that
 that person by that response she gave her before tells me they probably just could have talked about it
 and that client would have actually received some feedback on some things that she wasn't aware of
 she wasn't aware of how she was coming across and she needed the accountability and the feedback
 of just somebody to say guys that may be your leader no one ever tells them no one ever goes and says hey
 you're this is where you're kind of difficult with other people this is where I struggle with you
 I just want to talk with you about it I don't want to attack you but this is just some stuff I just
 want to talk about maybe it's me maybe there's some stuff you see that it may be worth it at times
 to have that conversation yeah it's it's amazing how much good healthy you know and and a good
 dose of humility kind of conversation and communication like we talk about around here high levels
 of quality communication it's amazing how far that will go to diffuse and deescalate situations
 when done rightly with the right motive with the right mindset it can completely turn around situations
 where you know maybe my tendency because of my personality style leadership stuff might be to
 advocate authority or leadership might be to isolate myself might be to prejudge but you know I forget
 I think of a senica who said we we suffer more in imagination than in reality and sometimes
 we build these air castles in our minds of how other people are and how they're going to respond you might
 you know coming back to your relationship with Chris you might have a tendency or he might have a tendency
 because of the years that you guys have worked very closely together to prejudge something but I
 imagine that every once in a while he surprises you and you surprise him and that communication needs
 to happen regardless exactly and you're you're right those it's like there's a lot of predicting how
 Chris is going to respond and he loves that I mean we we even we teach be a predictable leader
 don't leave your team always guessing are being like you know taking your temperature to have to
 figure out where you are you're trying to find consistency why because you're the leader and people look
 to you for approval and they look to you for to have their needs met you know what that's just part of
 the job you may not be asking for that but it tends to this be part of the job when you're the leader you're
 the manager so there's a great thing and having a predictable leader but you're right sometimes
 Chris will all of a sudden be like oh that's not what I was expecting and then I have to recalibrate
 and be like okay where is he right now and why does he view the thing the way that he views it
 or wow he has an objection to something that I didn't expect I wonder why he has said objection
 it's it becomes a learning opportunity but because we've logged a lot of time there is a lot of
 predictability and he will tell me it's like I basically know how Joel's going to do it and how he's
 going to respond but from time to time something will be like a little bit off or it'll be like oh that's
 not what I thought or I'll have a perspective that he simply wasn't thinking about and Chris operates
 for most of the time Chris operates really well and just tell me what you think and what do you think
 and what is your opinion and what is your input on that so we can ultimately make a better decision
 it doesn't have to be my decision it doesn't have to be Chris's decision where there's pride in that
 it's let's just make a good decision and then let's move forward yeah I love that so as we're as we're
 kind of starting to wrap up a little bit here what are the things that are coming to mind no matter who
 your leader is where they are on that that health or maturity spectrum you know bearing in mind that we
 no matter where we are in the organization in that hierarchy we're influencing all the time
 we're exerting influence and influencing also the culture with our words and actions it's our attitudes
 right and we're bringing that to the table every time I come to work every time you know we sit in a meeting
 every time that we're communicating to those leaders we are influencing and so bearing that in mind and
 I'm reminded again it's that healthy and also the humility side of this that is going to turn things
 in a favorable outcome you know the moment that we come in in an unhealthy way exerting influence
 in order to manipulate in order to get to you know our point of view or our desired outcome
 and not for the corporate good that's a that's a problem that's going to crop up and so you know changing
 the culture for the good is something that has to be that on the motivational level and that means
 sometimes I have to let go of my perspective because my leader decided to do something else other than
 what I had suggested and that doesn't mean that I'm not valuable it doesn't mean that I need to just
 go okay well he doesn't listen to me or she doesn't listen to me so I'm going to advocate I'm going to step back
 I'm going to isolate myself no it means okay in this particular you know context or situation they had to
 make a decision and they made it you know but my role is not to manipulate that outcome my role is to
 find the way to support to influence and be a positive you know asset in the company especially on their
 team as much as as I can yeah I agree I agree when it comes to influence it starts with you it's typically
 we worry about how are other people going to respond to stuff and then we stress and we get fear
 and we get self-protective in ways and and what I would offer everyone listening is who are you and how
 do you influence other people it's totally depends on how healthy you are and the choices that you make
 and the choices we make come from how healthy we are this is what I love about personal growth
 and learning hard things about our self of being a willing to see like oh I'm not I stink there
 well I'm toxic there and I never realized actually how and toxic is toxic it's such an ugly word
 and we want to avoid stuff like that but we've got to look for like I swear myself is where do I judge where
 do I make assumptions where do I put things on people where do I guilt people where do I wear my
 condescending where do I talk down to people where do I just convince myself of things and not gain
 perspective and it's like it's got to be my way and where do I fight to be right about stuff and and
 all these things that we need to really pursue growth on because then you can more healthily influence
 people around you at work or at home and as someone who teaches this stuff and I'm an ex
 of a life facilitator you will never in I teach people how do you do life better and this isn't from a
 place of oh Joel's got it all figured out Chris has it all figured out no we don't we fail at
 stuff all the time we learn new things all the time that we then go on to be better at what we do my wife and
 I we just hired a parenting coach people parenting coach that sounds weird sounds crazy well that's
 what she calls herself why did we do that because we are we adopted two kids our foster kids of three
 years we've had to be in that for over three years and we reached a point of difficulty where it's
 a quinoa what we're at information and we're tired of responding the ways that we are that aren't
 good and we don't like about ourselves or we're like you know what we need help here because it's how
 do we greatly influence our child who has trauma who come who's brain doesn't operate like like our
 older two kids he's needs are different and so we know what we know and that works for our older two
 kids it doesn't work for him so our influence on him as his leaders at times is it what it needs to be
 we need a new set of keys and so we've hired a person with a two coaching sessions has been a game
 changer we have seen so much change in him and the last two weeks more than we've seen in a long time now
 because we're now leading and influencing him because we are allowing our self to be influenced by
 an expert when it comes to leading a child with trauma and this is how influence works it ripple effects
 so who is that who are you today is like and who do you want to be and where do you see gaps
 so that you can pursue the information and that you can pursue whether it's like coaching with an
 organization like ours that helps you to see things and learn and grow to be a better influencer
 and a better leader and for the people around you in your life and to achieve bigger goals to improve the
 success of your team or the success of your business it all hinges on you and what you choose to do
 so I just this is why so strongly encourage people is to get help read books price God you're listening
 to podcasts like this that are hopefully helping and influencing you in a positive way so that you can be the
 better leader whether it's at home with your divide with my son or whether it's your team or whether it's
 the leaders that you're leading every day it's like what kind of influence do you want to have on people
 and then are you willing to reach out and actually get help and make it a priority to then implement
 what you're learning yeah no it's it's really helpful man there's so many good things there I just want
 to come back around and underline something you you said a few minutes ago about the consistency
 it's that's so huge being a predictable leader and being the predictable employee and in wherever you are
 in that hierarchy you know Chris said this and I think we've still got the blog post on our website you can
 probably just go to christocardo.com hit the little search bubble type in the word influence and you'd
 see a blog post on how to influence your leadership he said the key to influencing leadership or the
 leaders in your life is by example it doesn't matter how much you want to make a difference if you're
 not living the culture that you want to see nobody's going to care when you present as an idea you have to show
 every day that you believe in a better way if you want a culture of no gossip then you need to tell people
 who are gossiping to stop people need to be able to anticipate what why and how you're going to do
 something so they know where you stand if you want leaders in your life so that that blog post is
 up there on the website I think you'll be able to find it if you want leaders in your life to drop that
 guard a little bit be open to your point of view and perspective you've got to have that consistent
 predictability and you've got to be living out the culture that you as a leadership team are trying to
 create in the business and you've got to be setting the example and I think that's that's a huge
 key for somebody out there who may be frustrated with their role in the leadership team and whoever's over
 them leading by example with consistency having a healthy and a humble attitude is going to propel you
 forward in that relationship and that rapport with that leader over you you are already by doing those
