 Changing your family tree how your root system affects the legacy that you leave that is coming up next
 Welcome to the Chris LaCardo Show where we discuss leadership and life and
 Discover that business is what you do not who you are
 Welcome to the show folks. Let me ask you a question. What comes to your mind when you hear the word legacy
 For a lot of you it might be a legacy box
 You know a box full of letters full of passwords important documents
 A will you know insurance all that kind of fun stuff another could be a financial legacy leaving a
 Fortune no matter how big it is small it could be whatever but leaving a fortune to your family
 Which is a good thing to do and for a good reason as Proverbs 13 22 tells us good people even inheritance to their grandchildren
 So what what do you think of when it comes to legacy now while money is important?
 There are other kinds of legacies that we leave to our family and friends
 Like a spiritual legacy if you are someone who understands
 The importance and let me speak to you men especially God looks to us to be the ones who to lead our families our our spouses our children
 And to make let me say this way to make sure they have a relationship with him
 But ladies it is not up to your husband you've got to be responsible for your own relationship, right?
 But what are you leaving?
 Let's say for your kids is there a spiritual legacy that you're leaving for your kids did they know God?
 Do they know and you know again?
 You know we have plenty of people who are following who are non believers. That's fine
 Talk to us if you want to
 We'd love you free to be believers
 But here's a deal for those of you that are believers
 Here's what you have to ask yourself if you've not done a good job leading your kids into a relationship a healthy
 Relationship with God who's going to right don't put that responsibility on somebody else another good
 legacy you could leave is a character legacy right integrity
 Generosity kindness I can tell you for me say multiple times on the show
 Especially as I've been out working on
 We bought some some new property and I've been out there working on cutting in a road and drop in trees and you know
 Saw them up and splitting them by hand. Oh man let me tell you
 The body is tired, but here's one thing I can tell you
 the legacy of growing up with my mom teaching us how to have a great work ethic
 You know my brother and I out there drop in trees in the woods and and what you call bucking them up into rounds and then bringing them home and splitting them by hand
 As I'm out there drop in these trees. I am reliving that and thinking to myself
 I love that I get to be out here and do this or a lot of folks would pay somebody to do this but I get to get out there and
 Run a chainsaw or swing an axe right and I got to tell you
 It's hard work and I do not have a problem with it
 Some of my body parts do but
 As you get a little bit of a lot of life I have realized I am not a teenager anymore
 That that didn't take very long another great one you can leave is like a language and culture
 Like I see you know for a lot of folks
 My dad is from Sicily and so there are aspects of that culture that I get to experience or have been able to experience
 There you know we we have a great guy that we've worked with on a lot of stuff as far as like remodels and things like that
 Who has brought the legacy I believe he's from Ecuador. I think that's where he's from
 But just the legacy that he's pouring into his kids as he's raising them so there's a whole lot of great stuff that you can leave as far as good
 Like a sees there's also bad like a sees willy behind is well negative like a sees bad habits
 Patterns things that are picked up by our kids
 You know there is always this debate on if you have a the alcohol gene you know if you have an alcoholic in your family
 There's plenty people that will say oh well I have that gene inside of me and so that's why I don't drink
 Any gene inside of you that has a disposition to something that is negative has to be turned on
 It's not something that makes you all of a sudden go. I'm gonna pound a fifth of bourbon
 You know if I pick up the bottle. It's just the way that it's gonna happen. However
 There is something that can be picked up and that is watching a parent numb
 Without alcohol watching a parent numb with procrastination or submissiveness watching a parent
 You know lose control and
 Respond with controlling habits those are things that get picked up, but you know a terrible legacy is one of abuse or
 Strive and all kinds of broken relationships right another terrible legacy is one of carelessness
 You know one of not making good decisions with your finances or not making good decisions with relationships or so on and so forth or
 Avoiding relationships all of these things can leave really bad legacies behind another another
 Terrible one as that as we struggle with adults how many times we avoid our kids or we have a bad disposition
 And we never realize that our kids are reading into it that it's their fault
 That it's their problem so there's all kinds of bad legacies that we can leave behind as well negative legacies and we're gonna be addressing
 Some of this stuff or we're actually gonna be addressing a lot of stuff on our roots as the misshues
 And that actually does more to then just change our small branch of the family changes the DNA of the whole tree enabling us
 You know to bear different better more fruit so changing the family tree and leaving a legacy
 Means changing you
 If you do that then it changes your legacy and to change ourselves
 We're gonna dig into the root system when we come back right after this
 Folks if you've been listening to me for any length of time
 Then you know the number one issue when it comes to business when it comes to family when it comes to friendships
 Is having a lack of high quality communication to make sure that you are absolutely winning
 In every aspect of your life
 It all starts with having great communication
 The best way to get that communication is to understand your personality style and to understand the personality style of the folks that you're spending the most time with
 Whether it be at work, whether it be at home
 The best way to do that is to go to Chrissacord.com/store and get your personality profile and personality profiles for your team
 To day get it for your family members two day as you go through that profile
 You will begin to see the greatest ways to communicate go to Chrissacord.com/store today
 Okay, so I mentioned that we're gonna talk about root system today and there is a great episode free to go back to and that is what you have
 In common with wine that is a great episode free to listen to I believe it's a 1998 so go back and listen to that
 But we're gonna talk about the root system how it's formed in our soil the upbringing the environment the influences the instructions
 So let me just kind of explain to you what I mean by that. This is the foundation of what we teach in next level of life
 We all have so if you think about a root system now
 We are fans of wine around here
 I was raised in like Tahal's born in Sanoma and so I always have spent time going back to those two areas and I've always
 Loved racing and skiing and I've always loved wine as well and I actually enjoy the farming side of it immensely
 So for me, I used to always go in the offseason and I get to spend time with the wine makers and the growers and and
 You know the best wine
 Wine or ease let me say the best wine or ease
 We'll say that hey you have to be a great farmer if you're gonna make a great wine
 You can't just make a great wine out of junky, you know grapes, right?
 So you have to kind of understand how it works well if you take a
 Any fruit or vegetable they all have a process of digging down with roots through the ground to pick up water
 They're looking for water right
 But one of the things that wine grapes to
 Almost more than anything else now there's some debate that coffee does this the same way and I
 I don't know I can I understand it but I've never experienced anything that does it as much as this if you if you plant a
 an orange tree in
 California or Mexico or Florida the juice comes out tasting like an orange
 It doesn't come out tasting like a chocolate orange. It doesn't come out smelling like a
 You know tobacco and in the orange
 It doesn't take on as many characteristics of the
 Minerals that are in the ground as
 Wine grapes do and wine grapes get wine grapes get so much other boldness and their complexity from the minerals in the ground
 The wild yeast that grows on the grapes the tanons
 These are all things that affect the character of the wine well in the ground
 There is a different set of minerals for every layer right there could be some of the same minerals and some of the layers
 But as you go through different layers of soil and
 Those
 Roots dig further down which that's not the same as like a
 Tree now a tree will
 Well only goes far as it needs to to get water
 When you are growing wine grapes our goal is to get those those roots as far down as we possibly can because it picks up so much of the minerals
 And it deposits the expression of those minerals into the grapes so without going into all the details of the
 What you what you have and come over with wine episode
 Understand that the the major goal we're talking about or the major piece we're talking about is how many different deposits it pulls from the ground
 Into the fruit now
 What does that have to do with what we're talking about today? Well, guess what?
 There's something that we have to get in life and that is we are responsible for our own
 Behaviors as we walk through next level life
 There's a saying that we have we don't make any monsters and we don't make any victims
 Right we may have gone through horrible things in life
 But our goal isn't to sit and make monsters of people
 But it's also not to sit be a victim to those situations
 All right our goal is how do we find out how to make better decisions in life?
 We don't want to sit there and feel every bad experience
 We don't want to sit there and talk through like run a on a couch
 You know of all how we felt through all of the different things instead our goal is how do we get to the why the thing exists?
 So we can make better decisions in life
 So when you look at the root system one of the major things that we talk about
 And again, it's it's a difficult thing to understand right here. So just I'm gonna give you the the
 Cliff notes version
 There are things that happen in life and things that we experience with parents and grandparents and siblings and friends and
 You know influences in life
 That become deposits in our root system and as we go through and experience those deposits
 They shape a lot of our decision making. This is super super super important for you to hear
 We base a lot of our decision making on the deposits in our root system and
 The reason why we do so much of this mainly is because we don't understand the deposits in the first place
 We don't understand for a lot of folks
 They don't even recognize what happened for some folks they recognize what happened to have no but for everybody
 They don't understand why these things exist why do they happen? Why did my
 Parents ignore me as a kid why did you know why did my why was my mom so controlling with my dad?
 How come my dad didn't have a backbone all these different pieces?
 We have to discover a lot of perspective and as we gain perspective
 We can see how those are affecting our decision making process so for example if I have a
 Controlling parent and a submissive parent and I'm not talking about two parents that do really well together
 I'm talking about one who's
 Constantly trying to control the other tell the other one. They're not good enough
 Point out all their flaws all of these different pieces then I have this conflict in my brain
 Because these are supposed to be two great parents. They're supposed to be healthy
 They're supposed to be the earthly representation of God
 Thus there isn't so many of you who do not believe in God
 Don't believe in God because you're looking at your parents and go on that's what got to be what God is like
 No, it is not do not blame God for how this kids are acting right?
 He's many times you could see your kids acting out of way that you did not teach them to act
 But they're still your kids and you still love them, right?
 Hopefully you do so a lot of those situations create
 Thought processes in our minds and we base decisions on those deposits
 Here's the deal
 Those deposits get passed down those experiences in our lives
 We perpetuate into our kids we pass on into our kids
 Even the person who says I am gonna be nothing like my parent. I'm not gonna be anything like my mom
 I'm not gonna be anything like my dad
 They do what we call the pendulum swing
 They go from where their parent is or parents all the way over to the exact opposite side and then end up doing the same thing from a different direction
 Just in a different way
 These are things that we perpetuate into our kids and what we help people to see is how they got there in the first place
 Why because then we can make much better decisions
 Right, so we have to gain a lot of information if you look at Luke 645 in the message
 It says you don't get warming apples off a healthy tree
 nor good apples off a distressed tree
 You don't get warming apples off a healthy tree
 Nor good apples off a disease tree the health of the apple tells the health of the tree
 You must begin with your own life giving lives
 It's who you are not what you say and do that counts why you're true being brims over into true words and
 Deeds so let me flip this around if you want to know that somebody's coming from a pretty jacked up background or jacked up root system
 Look at their words and their deeds
 Look at how they respond in life, right and it doesn't listen
 There's tons of people coming from jacked up backgrounds that have made better decisions and choose to continue to make better decisions in life
 And not allow that root system to affect them too terribly much
 But here's a great thing when they do discover the lines
 Then they discover freedom not the what's a lot of folks know the what right?
 They know what exists in their root system. They just don't understand why out of our root system
 Close thought patterns positive and negative there is so much
 Every single one of you listening right every one of us has negative self talk
 Every one of us this is hard for some people not not a lot
 Probably about five percent of the folks that come to next level
 If this is a tough thing for them to realize every one of us lie to each other to ourselves every one of us lies to ourselves
 We tell ourselves things about us that just aren't truth. I'm never gonna be accepted by anybody
 I'm never gonna be in a good relationship. I'm never gonna make enough money in life
 I'm never gonna be thought of as pretty or handsome or funny or intelligent
 We tell ourselves all of these lies. I'm never gonna be good enough for my parents
 I'm never gonna be good enough for my spouse. I'm never gonna be good enough for my my my friends
 It's my responsibility to make everybody happy in life
 We tell ourselves all of these lies
 Because they're coming from our surface level responses these responses that we do in life
 Because we don't understand why the stuff in our root system exists
 This is the important piece of knowing your root system
 It's one thing to know what the power is understanding why it exists
 so if I can see why my father was so submissive to my controlling mother if I can understand why he didn't have a backbone and didn't stand up
 Then I can understand why I've made a whole lot of decisions in my life
 If I can understand why my mom is so submissive to my controlling father
 You know it's the same concept right?
 There's so many different equations involved in our root system
 But we base our thought patterns in our surface level responses on watching and being taught as
 Where kids
 Once again, this is not victim mentality. We don't get to blame our parents or grandparents or
 Our aunts and uncles are our teachers. That's not the concept
 That doesn't mean that we get to be entitled and blame everybody for everything. That is not the purpose
 The purpose is perspective
 The sooner we understand that so much of our decision making process is based on the stuff in our root system
 The sooner we can make better
 More powerful more healthy decisions
 But without understanding that stuff we don't just turn right make better decisions
 We instead we just you know we might even make better decisions, but we hold on to a bunch of
 Lies and negative self-talk or even limiting belief systems
 So we have to understand that the stuff that's in our root system creates what we would call that surface level the stuff that's on the surface
 which is all of those
 funky decision making processes bad decision making processes unhealthy decision making processes
 This is referred to as our internal or interior lives the heart of a person can be easily
 polluted
 When we don't understand
 What we're being trained on or taught or experiencing
 So on and so forth Proverbs 423 says God you're heart above all else
 For determines the course of your life
 If we do not guard our hearts if we allow everything that we're watching around us to affect us and impact us and then
 Absolutely got our decision making processes then guess what?
 There's a really good chance we're gonna make a lot of bad decisions in life
 So tending the root system
 To make changes to that internal or interior life we have to first discover what we struggle with
 What are the things that we are struggling with what are the things that we are experiencing?
 There's a we do this process where we have folks fill out their surface level responses before they ever come in and
 Then we add to it as we go throughout the vet. It's always funny because people are like oh you're putting more up there
 Yes, the goal is to see as many as they're can possibly be this is in a scorecard of how bad you are
 We want to see everything you're struggling with so that we can tackle it
 So that we can get rid of it so we can put healthy things in place
 You got to first discover the the what that you're struggling with next you have to discover why we struggle with it
 this
 Is the powerful piece of next level life
 Getting to why things exist and I can tell you
 Probably about 25% or more people bring their spouse to come sit in on their event and
 Every time somebody brings the spouse in we will tell the spouse now listen
 You're gonna hear me get to some things and you're gonna jump out and say a lot of tolder that a thousand times
 I told him that a thousand times and then I'm gonna ask you a question did it ever work and you're gonna say no
 And I'm gonna say that's because you keep putting out the what not the why
 Everybody can see the why and there's everybody can see the what in their spouse
 It's not difficult to see that your spouse is struggling with something
 But what the the example I use is is when you see somebody who is screwing up their life with drugs and you go
 Hey, you're screwing up your life with drugs. They go
 Yep, you're right. Well you should stop doing that. Yep, you're right
 Thank you so much for that fantastic advice
 But I still don't understand why I'm struggling so heavily with drugs, right?
 Why is this thing that is something that will not leave me or I don't seem to be able to change
 Because the what isn't the thing that changes you?
 It's getting to the great understanding of why next thing we have to do is we've got to see healing
 Restoration in those areas now once again our job and next level life is not to lay you down on a couch and talk to you about all these experiences
 Our goal is to get you as much perspective as we possibly can so that we can show you the route
 To healing now we've had some folks that have had straight up
 phenomenal healing right then an air during their event
 But for everybody it's a practice after you leave
 100% of people have to then go practice the healthy tools we've given them
 Actually have to practice the things putting the things in place to make sure that they stay get or stay healthy, right?
 So you've got this you've got to seek that healing process that redemption restorative process nothing you need to do
 You need to seek to change your decision making in habits
 so
 Many of you already understand
 That there's a lot of decisions that you're making that probably aren't the healthiest things
 It could be the way you lose your your temper
 It could be the way that you procrastinate it could be the way that you control or manipulate somebody it could be the way that you avoid or
 Hold back love from somebody it could be the way that you call somebody out so that you can communicate to them them that they're not good enough or not good enough for you or not worthy
 There's all kinds of stuff that we do that we need to change there's all kinds of habits that we have to do that we need to change
 To get healthier now if you are very happy with where you are then just stay right where you are but you know
 We have folks that want to actually have a better life even if they've never had anything bad happen ever
 In their life they want to know the tools so that they can have a better life
 So if you seek to change your decision making process
 Then an incredible thing happens you start changing the future and you start changing your family tree
 The more healthy the decisions you make in life the more healthier life becomes
 folks
 The root system is mainly coming from our family tree
 Guess what
 You're perpetuating that into your kids and if you don't have kids you're going to and if you're somebody who actually says
 I don't ever want to have kids I can help you out with this one
 99% chance that's because you didn't like the way things happen when you were a kid and you don't want to perpetuate that
 Truth is all this is solvable right you can change your future and you can change your family tree
 One of the things we don't think about
 is how we are impacting and perpetuating our root system into our kids how we are affecting their decision making process
 So many of us have this great idea that if we leave a
 Financial legacy to our kids oh gosh, we've been amazing parents or if we leave this cultural
 Legacy to our kids wow look at what we've done and we miss out on something incredibly important
 Our kids would much rather have a very healthy future and a very healthy relationship with their family
 Over money over stuff
 Right so sometimes we think to ourselves if I just put in a great estate plan
 Then I will have done my job as a dad. No, no, no
 If you put in a great estate plan and you've taught your kids to have horrible character
 They will blow through that they will screw themselves up. They will screw their kids up
 They will screw everything up
 You already know that part, right?
 Wow, but Chris I don't know how to okay, well then find out how I don't know how to lead my won't find out how to lead your kids
 But here's the key
 The most important piece if you don't understand you and you don't have that perspective of where you come from and what you've experienced and what you've been trained on
 What you've been taught and what you've allowed and the decision making process you make
 Then you're not gonna change the way you do stuff for your kids
 You will perpetuate it
 So yes, should you leave and inheritance to your children?
 Absisting can literally you should leave it to your children's children, right?
 But what's more important than a financial legacy?
 Well for me a correct relationship with God
 There's spiritual legacy. Yeah, but I don't have one of those myself great
 Learn why and then learn how to fix that learn how to get those tools coming up next
 We're gonna talk about what I successfully changed family tree really looks like
 Hey folks, if you're feeling stuck anxious not good enough or held back in life
 Then you need to go through our next level life
 That's why we created this two-day event process the power of next level life is that it helps you discover
 your specific root system
 Why you believe what you do?
 How you make decisions and why you are where you are in life?
 You learn the things that are holding you back in life and how to overcome them
 You'll come away having found healing and ready to start living with purpose and authenticity
 So if you're ready to stop struggling and if you're ready to find greater peace and head over to
 Chrissletcurd.com/nexlevellife and next level life is wedding for you. That's Chrissletcurd.com/nexlevellife today
 Okay, so here's what I want you to do. I want you to imagine
 The legacy you can leave
 For your spouse for your kids for your grandkids, right?
 What legacy are you leaving your family right now?
 Imagine what it could be imagine how much better it can be
 Mike Forster who is a client who's been through has become a friend the family has just become friends of ours
 They're just phenomenal people, but he's leaving a better legacy to his family than he ever thought possible
 Here's what Mike says
 Before I attended next level life my family was on the brink of shambles
 We were breaking and drifting apart next level. I've helped me to see how I was reacting to triggers
 What impact they had on my personal and professional decisions and how my reactions impacted my wife and children
 Through the process. I was changing me at the core. Let me say that again. Let me read that lot again
 Because somebody folks think that they're gonna come through this and change their family. Well my family's own the trunk
 Hey, through the process. I was changing me at my core and it took
 Serded an intentional effort the relationships we have now
 Would never have occurred without next level life. It's provided us the opportunity to have healthy and whole relationships
 Not only with ourselves, but also with each other our relationships are close
 honest
 Interesting. It took time and patience to get here
 Folks
 Here's what I want you to understand
 You have to be as Mike said intentional
 You have to actually make the effort
 to make change
 You have I love it literally
 In the building right now upstairs is somebody who has known since we had the discussion
 Earlier has known since 2013 that she should go through the cement
 And now she's in it and loving it and having life change
 But it's amazing when she when I asked hey what what made you decide to come here and she's like oh, you don't even want it
 Shout out to you Tiffany all you don't even want it. Oh
 Then she backed up and said I know I should have done this
 Since 2013 and praise God praise God herner husband are here and they are experiencing this event
 Why because they want to change their family tree they want to change their own lives
 They want to change their own decision making
 They want to change life for the better they want to understand things
 They want to understand how things happen and why they occur that way and and why they make decisions the way that they do
 You can do the same exact thing
 Here's what we have to realize every generation is a hinge generation
 It can go one or two ways
 The key is it depends on you
 You can perpetuate the problems in your family's root system or you can get that junk out
 You can get unstuck you can move past it and overcome it and again
 Some folks come in and they have a great life
 But they know it's not the best it could be and some folks come in they've had the absolute or stuff happen that you can imagine
 And it changes their lives. It doesn't matter where you are
 It's something that can impact every single person and more importantly it can impact your family tree as well
 So changing your family's future
 Living a lasting legacy
 These things hinge on the choices that you make day by day
 Every day
 So the longer you wait to get your life
 changed
 I am not saying you need to be fixed
 Listen we all need fixing we all need changing right so do not hear oh you're the problem you just got to be fixed
 Understand every person walking this planet needs next level life
 Every person needs to learn the things that they've been trained and trained wrong let me give you a
 crazy example
 It's not actually not that crazy
 But I am somebody who grew up in a lot of sports
 Right I played sports all growing up
 But I didn't play golf until later on in life
 And I am somebody who swings for the fences I may
 What they would call a power hitter which is why I usually spend most of my time chasing my ball that is gone way into the trees
 Because I swing so hard now is out on the course with a buddy of mine Keith and he was standing behind me watching me swing
 And he goes hey
 Let me give you a little bit of advice
 He goes here's what I want you to do he said don't go all the way over with your club stop at three quarters
 Three quarters swing and everything inside me went
 But I won't have all my power
 I have so much more strength if I go all the way back
 He's like just stop at three fours to the way well I know Keith and I know how great of a a golfer he is
 So I took his advice
 I pulled back stop that three fours of the way and then pull all the way through the ball
 Amazingly
 I knocked that ball well over the green
 Now
 Here's what happened I continued to play the way that he was telling me to play
 I gained 20 yards on every one of my clubs. I had to readjust the number of the club in my head
 So if I hit one club a hundred yards
 I now had to know I now hit that club 120
 So I had to back up and change everything because all of a sudden I got new learning
 The old learning of come all the way back and swing through for me was bad teaching
 It was bad training
 Why because to a guy who swings super hard
 That type of process actually messes me it causes me to lose in life. It's the same exact thing
 When it comes to your decision making in life
 If you have bad influence if you have bad training and it doesn't even have to be intentional
 Listen to me it doesn't have to be intentional
 Right as I said at the top of the show we don't make any monsters or victims out of this process
 We gain perspective so we can learn new tools
 New ways of doing things to make better decisions
 And having somebody watch the swing that you have in your golf stance and then making an adjustment changes the way you hit the ball
 It's the same thing in life. Same thing with your decision making process. So
 Folks let me hit you with one more thing
 Many people are so concerned about what they're gonna be remembered for I will tell you that is not my concern
 I'm not concerned I don't I don't I don't
 Try and set my life up so that people remember me that is not what I'm looking for God
 Remember me God knows me God has a plan for me
 Here's what I'm looking for
 Am I doing the things am I living a life do I have the character
 Do I have the love do I have the obedience to God that?
 Down the road when I'm gone somebody will go this is what I remember about Chris
 This is his character
 This is what I loved about him. This is what I thought about him
 If you spend time focusing on how people are gonna remember you then you will spend time
 Selfishly trying to live a life that causes people to remember you
 If you live a life for God and you live a life with great character
 Great love
 Great quality you don't ever have to worry about setting up that memory
 You'll be remembered
 People will know so don't wait make the decision to
 Gain information and perspective
 So that you can change your life just get the perspective
 Go to christicurter.com/nexlovelife and just get the perspective
 To make it a decision if you want to change your life
 It's that simple
 All right, well folks hopefully this has been helpful for you today here's what I want you to do. I want you to imagine
 You're legacy
 Imagine the legacy you can leave. Oh, but I don't have a good light. It doesn't matter
 What can you leave?
 What do you want to leave?
 What do you want to perpetuate into your kids your grandkids and so on
 Imagine the legacy you can have
