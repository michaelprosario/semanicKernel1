 Folks, you're listening to Part 2 of how to let Gove Control.
 Now, if you haven't listened to Part 1, you're going to want to pause and listen to it first.
 It's episode 353.
 There is some powerful stuff in there that I don't want you to miss.
 Now, I'm excited to share with you the conclusion of this episode, so let's dive in.
 Welcome to the Crystal of Cardo Show, where we discuss leadership and life and discover
 that business is what you do, not who you are.
 All right, folks, we are back and we are talking about letting Gove Control.
 We've had a lot of stuff today, and the thing I think I want to make sure you're hearing us say.
 Yes, that when we as humans take control, we are limited by our created ability, not creative.
 We are the created beings.
 We're limited by our human abilities.
 We're limited by, you know, what God gave us as far as taking control of our lives.
 When we rely on him, we are allowing the power of God to guide and direct us to where he wants us to be.
 Our culture is just a graveyard of those ships who were sailing that direction didn't get there,
 shipwrecked, and yet we don't seem to take clues from that.
 It's like we just ignore it.
 Like it's just a bird.
 It's part of the tour.
 Well, they never made it.
 Well, I guess I'll keep trying thinking that we're going to arrive somewhere, and yet we miss that whole pilgrimage.
 We miss that whole journey, and we miss being transformed along the way, not by the destination, but by the hard work along the way.
 Right, and we keep thinking that, you know, like you say, that as we go through that graveyard,
 well, they weren't good enough.
 For they made a mistake, or I'm going to do better than they did at what?
 If your destination is man's approval.
 If your destination is worth from applause.
 If your destination is the number of likes on your social media page.
 If your destination is the amount of money in your bank account, the house that you own, the cars that you drive.
 If your destination is that, then do not be surprised that everything else fails.
 Because of your choice of what you want your destination to be.
 Don't be surprised that your kids follow after the same stuff and are screwed up.
 Don't be surprised that your relationship with God is not that good.
 Don't be surprised that you have money but no friends.
 Don't be surprised.
 And I don't think we're saying that those things are evil.
 No, not themselves.
 But when we objectify them as a goal, and we place them in a hierarchy or a priority that's above all else, it is an idol.
 As the destination.
 It's something that our heart, it idolizes at worships.
 And it becomes a goal.
 It becomes a destination again that we want to have control over, that we get our value and worth from.
 And we're willing to sacrifice anything or anyone along the way to get there.
 It's a poor master and it's a poor motivation.
 And it doesn't set us up well to live life well.
 Right.
 And to run a business well and to lead others well and rightly.
 And so it's like we're shooting ourselves in the foot, limping along on this pilgrimage and being forced to complete the journey.
 But we're our biggest obstacle in all of this.
 So as we talk about this, we're going to shift into what does it mean or what does it like to be still in this.
 The things that we're saying.
 If you are in control, then the destination will always be your destination.
 It will not necessarily involve God's destination for you.
 I, in my earlier years, the first half of my life, I spent time trying to make my destination happen for the second half of my life.
 I've been focusing on trying to end up at God's destination where he wants me to go.
 And there's not just one.
 There's 700 different stops along the way.
 Right.
 When I'm in control, I'm focused on whatever takes for me to get where I want to be.
 Where God has really shown me and smacked me upside the head sometimes of going,
 "You can have this.
 I'll even let you have it."
 But understand, I've got something way better over here.
 If you follow me, it will be so much better.
 We talked about this the other day with Steph, our new intern, who we love dearly.
 The other day when we're talking about how, you know,
 NT Wright talks about that foggyness.
 There's those road signs moving into a fog.
 And you can speak to that much better than I can.
 But I know when I was in control of my life, the destination was clear.
 I could see it because I knew where I was headed.
 And I knew how to get there.
 And I knew the things had to work on.
 And if things torpedoed it, then I just figured out how to get back on that path.
 Interestingly, the moment I heard that it was, I resonated so greatly with that.
 I can see the signs and I'm following the signs, but the destination is foggy.
 And, you know, I think what we say a lot around here is we're holding things with open hands.
 You know, the minute we grip on the reins and try to control and manipulate outcomes is the minute that we really lose control.
 We lose objectivity going after that object or that goal.
 And so I think we're learning, you know, I forget how many times we counted.
 We had this conversation before I left seven years ago, probably.
 We had this conversation about the book of Proverbs. I think we counted that there were six times and six different ways in Proverbs,
 where it says that there's many plans and a man's heart, but the Lord directs his steps.
 And so what does that say to us is planning wrong is projecting wrong is having an idea of how he's designed you and understand yourself and what he's put you on earth to do wrong.
 No, but in doing that and in pleasing him and in walking out obedience, we hold it with open hands and allow him to direct us and we have to have these priorities right.
 Because at the end of the day, those plans and those projections are poor masters, they're poor motivations because eventually they'll lead us to abuse.
 Our power abuse money, abuse people, as means to an end. And so we're keeping these things with open hands, but somehow we have to detach from that objective or from that object that we're focused on.
 Our object has to be Jesus.
 It has to be him. It has to be the Lord as a master.
 And so then what becomes our motivation is serving and loving and obedience and that changes everything.
 That changes how we treat people, how we steward resources, it affects every sphere of life.
 Yeah, I think I'm so glad you brought that up because what I want to make sure people are not hearing because we, God's a planner.
 He always has been a planner. He has many plans. He has great plans for us. He is a planner.
 And sometimes you can hear in a, again, in a bad Western Christian message, don't plan anything. Plan have plans. God, God doesn't have any problem with you having plans.
 What he does want you to do is have that openness to when he decides to make you turn right.
 When he decides to make you turn left. And that's a big piece of it. So stillness.
 Let's talk about that. Because we're asking how, how do I mean, because we toggle back and forth between these, you know, these opposites, these polar opposites, the pendulum goes back and forth.
 Let go and let God, oh, Jesus, take the wheel. I mean, it's this whole idea of either I'm in control or he's in control. I'm in control.
 Well, the truth is he is absolutely in control. He has sovereign over all over you over me over the outcomes, over the circumstances, over everything.
 And so then the better question to ask is God, what are you doing right now in my, my circumstance and my situation. How can I cooperate with you?
 How can I be obedient, walk in faith and respond to whatever you're calling me to right now in this season where I am. But how do we, how can we gain some perspective and gain some clarity over where that is?
 Like we said at the beginning, if it's not here or there or somewhere in between in this nebulis fog, how can we gain some clarity?
 It really has to do with as you told me today at lunch shut up and listen.
 Shut up and listen Brian, shut up and listen.
 Because that's how I lead.
 And I took it so well. Hey, you're not listening to me shut up and listen.
 So that's a joke folks. So blaze Pascal has a phenomenal quote that I think, gosh, it was so.
 Obviously, so relevant in his time, but it just seems ridiculously relevant now.
 Right. All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sick quietly in a room alone.
 Yeah.
 Talk about that.
 Well, as I'm thinking about this, the other day staff meeting to bring up stuff against deaf if you're listening.
 Years are probably burning, but we were kind of going around talking about our bios.
 We're going to put some new bios on the website. So be looking.
 We've got a new website coming to and a couple of the couple of those present had put I like to have a cup of coffee and sit in quiet.
 Yeah, so funny because one of the things we're saying is favorite food parings.
 Parings.
 Because I'm your defouciate change that title. I don't know.
 No, I think it's very great. Yeah, because you know, I'm a foodie. A lot of us are here.
 But it's so funny when you asked the question, the response was not what we would have thought to foods.
 It's coffee and quiet.
 Yeah.
 Steph was coffee and quiet.
 Holly was really before my kids wake up.
 It's coffee and quiet.

 The sum of our circumstances is either not purposeful or ending in the direction that we really believe we want to be in, no matter what we're still looking at as us.
 Here's these situations.
 These are all happening because I've made bad decisions or I've done made good decisions or we leave out the king of the universe.
 We leave out that there is a better plan and a better decision by somebody.
 And so for me, what I'm saying is that it's okay to be in that place of confusion.
 It's okay to be in that place of being restless.
 It's okay to be in that place of even a madagot.
 I'm upset that I'm here.
 I'm upset that I've had that in my life.
 You can say that.
 You can say that.
 He can take it.
 He's a big guy.
 He can take it.
 He can handle that.
 He actually knows you're going to say it read the Psalms and you will see somebody a couple of people going through tough times, shaking a fist, giving that out and having those outbursts and then coming back to.
 But I know you're in control.
 And if that's where we end up have the outbursts.
 I haven't say it.
 Say what you need to say.
 Get that out knowing that at the end of the day you're wrestling with your own powerlessness.
 You're wrestling with coming to terms with the fact that you and I are not absolutely in control of every little thing.
 And thank you, John Mayer.
 Say what you need to say.
 Say what you need to say.
 Is that mayor?
 I think it's mayor.
 I don't know.
 But it's okay to do that.
 It's okay to be frustrated.
 It's okay to feel as though you are waiting as doesn't have purpose.
 But here's what we want you to understand.
 Press in.
 Press into God.
 Spend way more time in prayer.
 Discover.
 Listen.
 Take a look at people that have struggled.
 Take a look at people that have shaken their fist at God.
 I've definitely shaken my fist at God.
 It's senseless.
 He is the one who knows everything and who has, you know, my best interest at heart.
 We had this discussion yesterday of all the things that people are experiencing in the office that are painful, difficult times.
 And I'm not going to go through all of them right now.
 But if you go around the team, almost everybody has some sort of painful, difficult, troubling thing going on.
 And yet God continues to send us people here.
 We continue to help people change their lives.
 We just had another salvation that came through.
 I mean, it's just fantastic.
 You know, all of the things that are happening when you look around.
 What I ask for all the pain and suffering.
 Well, I guess I do it all the time.
 Every time I keep asking him, grow me closer to you,
 make me more like Christ.
 Help me to, you know, be great in the kingdom of heaven and not least in the kingdom of heaven.
 You know, as I ask for those things,
 suffering comes my way and praise God because I've been through enough of it.
 I stand better.
 I stand longer.
 I have learned to sit in the silence.
 I've learned that the pilgrimage, the journey toward God,
 has become way better walking and following the road signs into the fog,
 then walking directly into the clarity that I know was my own vision.
 That we think we have.
 Right.
 Exactly.
 And while it's been tougher,
 the blessings have been immense.
 Focus on the obedience.
 What's got asking for you?
 Recognize that God himself says,
 I want your obedience more than I want your sacrifice.
 Be obedient.
 So if you do these things, then letting go of control will just be easy.
 I don't think we can promise them.
 We can put that up there.
 Let's take that out in the end.
 Okay.
 I could tell you it will definitely be worth it.
 Here's what we can say.
 This is coming from Hebrews chapter 12.
 No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening.
 Maybe it feels like a season of purposelessness, senselessness, why am I in these circumstances,
 but recognizing God's ultimate control over every aspect of our lives.
 And us leaning into him to hear his voice and be obedient.
 It's not always going to feel enjoyable while it's happening.
 In fact, it's painful.
 But he says,
 "Afterward, there will be a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way."
 He says, "Make straight paths for your feet so that those who are weak and lame will not fall, but become strong."
 Powerful.
 So there you have it, folks.
 Hopefully this has helped you.
 I know it helps us.
 It's stuff that we teach all the time.
 It's stuff that we help folks through next level of life to get to a better understanding,
 get to a clear path to be able to be still, to be able to battle the negative self-talk,
 to be able to let go of the control, to be able to recognize when they're trying to control people or outcomes,
 and to how to get over that and get rid of that and be able to put healthy decisions in place.
 Well, brother, thank you for joining me on this show.
 This was fantastic.
 This was really good.
 And folks, again, I hope this has helped you today.
