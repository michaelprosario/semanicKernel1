 On today's episode part two of examining our lives to find the lies that we tell ourselves that is coming up next.
 Welcome to the Crystal Acredo Show where we discuss leadership and life and discover that business is what you do not who you are.
 Welcome to the show folks. I hope you're having a fabulous day wherever you are. On the previous episode I mentioned a quote that said the
 Unexamine the life is not worth living. Well today is an invitation to do just that to examine your life to make sure
 That it's worth living once again
 Not living is not an option. That's not what I'm saying but examining your life to say
 What life is worth living, right? What should it look like?
 The life filled with worry doubt fear strife complaining, blame-shifting isn't really a great life
 So when I say it's not worth living I'm not saying don't live. I'm saying change
 Do something different you do not have to live that way, right?
 We need to examine what needs to be enhanced and what needs to be edited out as
 This can be an incredible boost to personal growth to longevity and to health
 So for more on that check out episode 49 on
 Developing your personal growth plan now. Here's a deal
 Without examining our lives our thoughts our actions our reactions
 We tend to get stuck in harmful and distorted thinking patterns
 All right, so let's pick up kind of where we left off on the last episode by the way
 If you if you didn't tune into that then you want to go back to episode 495 as it sets up the context for what we're getting into
 today now reading again from Genesis 3
 When God is approaching Adam and Eve after they have eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
 The man says too God I heard you approaching and I was afraid there's the fear we talked about that last time
 There's the fear jumps out
 Immediately you know some versions say I was ashamed which that's fine too
 But we can see how he's responding when he knows that something is wrong
 That he has done something wrong against God the man continues and he blinds them both the woman
 That you put here with me the woman that you gave me
 Shared some fruit from the tree and I ate it
 So he blamed just very quickly to the woman and he blamed just very quickly to God in just one sentence
 We think that that's again a smart move
 But as we go through this episode and we do know that Eve's in the same boat
 She does the same thing she says then the Lord said to the woman you know what what is this you have done in the woman said this serpent
 Deceived me and I ate so again we see the same concept instead of taking personal responsibility
 Oh my gosh, I did exactly the opposite of what you told me to do I screwed this thing up
 Now you are so right now I you know
 I wish I didn't know all the things I know now, but here's where I am I'm so sorry instead of doing that
 Immediately blame shifting
 It's not my fault. It's somebody else's fault. So
 What were they both doing self-protecting as we talked about in the last episode?
 This was a whole bunch of shame a whole bunch of loss of worth
 And if you look at the reason why they got there in the first place it was not trusting and believing they got ahead
 They're best interest at heart. It was listening to lies from the serpent
 So here's what we've got to see because if Adam and Eve did it
 Think guess what we're gonna do it to
 right
 If the first human beings were able to sin self-protect
 lie
 Be victims
 Pretty darn sure we're gonna experience that as well. So when we come back getting perspective and getting power
 over the lies of victim mentality
 Folks if you've been listening to me for any length of time
 Then you know the number one issue when it comes to business when it comes to family when it comes to friendships
 Is having a lack of high quality communication to make sure that you are absolutely winning in every aspect of your life
 It all starts with having great communication
 The best way to get that communication is to understand your personality style and to understand the personality style of the folks that you're spending the most time with whether
 Be at work or there be at home the best way to do that is to go to
 Cricacard.com/store and get your personality profile and personality profiles for your team two day get it for your family members
 Today as you go through that profile
 You will begin to see the greatest ways to communicate go to cricacard.com/store today
 So what do we learn from these first humans?
 Well and trying to get out of a mess
 Ness and sin they end up making a big mess
 You know what I said it's so funny growing up
 my mom used to tell me if you just tell me
 What you did wrong before I go find out or have to dig and find more information if you just tell me it's gonna be so much easier on you than if I find out about it
 And you hadn't told me and that that was something for me a high-s personality style
 Man, I just stayed away from a lot of trouble
 But if I did do trouble or something or got caught or something I it wasn't hard for me to say
 Exactly what happened because I knew a worse punishment is not something I want to try
 So here's a funny thing what does that I'm gonna eat do and we've all done this you know
 Immediately I'm a victim you know wasn't my fault I didn't do it
 It wasn't we've seen this before was my job
 I'm not responsible for what happened there
 It was someone else. I'm just the victim to this situation right nothing to see here
 God we're all just victims move along move along right
 [laughs]
 Well, I didn't work out so well for them and it's probably not working out so great for us either
 It's time to get unstuck from victim mentality because it's holding you back
 Tolding you back from the life and possibility the business career you really really want right
 So it's time to get unstuck from victim mentality
 You know because it's holding you back from the life and possibly the business career that you really
 Really want and speaking of getting unstuck from victim mentality
 Making progress and moving forward in life and business. Let me pause and mention that we're coming up on our

 Thank you for being a massive part of that now. Let's get back to the garden if we're honest about our situation
 We're not so different about Adam and Eve
 Blame shifting only serves to perpetuate victim mentality and to keep us emotionally immature, right?
 so
 False failures mistakes they have to be dealt with in the garden. We know that they send
 We we could see that clear today. Now obviously we've got you know 6,000 years of
 of hindsight
 But they tried to cover themselves up, but it only served as a mass for their shame
 All right nothing can remove our sin but God himself which he offers to each and every one of us through
 Jesus Christ is kingdom of forgiveness
 However
 We can take responsibility for ourselves and we can
 Stop playing the role of a victim now
 Now that we're ready to examine the lies. Let's take a break
 When we come back uncovering the lies that you may be telling yourself about your own victim
 Freedom it's so powerful. I don't rejuvenate and almost renewed. I just felt so welcome and loved and accepted for who I am and not an ounce of judgment
 So I was very comfortable there
 That had a really big impact on me. It's going to be worth it
 It's gonna be hard
 But it's going to be even better on the other side for me. It was just very refreshing and
 I want to say life giving for me and really was you know I would go to the next of a life
 Again and probably again and probably again and probably again
 Because it's so powerful if you want to experience the same kind of life transformation the same kind of self-awareness and freedom that they have or
 Maybe you're just curious what the process would look like for you then head on over to
 ChrissaCurdo.com/nextlevellife
 So let's be honest. Let's examine our lives. Let's self-assess and let's make changes
 We're necessary. I want you to live a better life
 So here's my top 10 list of yeah might be a victim if now fun little take on Jeff Foxworthy
 You might be a victim if you feel like life and others are out to get you
 Folks I
 Do want to as I hit some of this stuff with a little bit of humor and I push on you to make good solid decisions
 I do want you to understand
 We understand
 We know that there are a lot of folks who literally believe that the lies have been so compounded in their brain
 For so long that they actually do believe people are out to get them
 We see that often
 And when we see it
 It is something that it breaks our hearts and we want to do everything we possibly can to help people overcome it
 But to overcome it it doesn't do any good just to tell people nope that's not true
 Right you have to find out where that came from
 How did that become a what we call a surface level response how did that become a a
 Response that happens on a continual basis right
 So when we say that you know you might be a victim if you feel like life and others are out to get you
 We understand
 Many of you and where you've come from
 The key is we want you to see it we want you to get to a place of recognizing as well
 You might be a victim if you attract people who complain about their lives folks folks folks
 If you are surrounded by
 Complaining people people who complain about their lives guess what you're complaining about your life as well
 You do not find healthy people
 self-aware people hanging around with people who complain about their lives
 You don't see healthy people attracting people who complain about their lives who stay very long
 Right it's not uncommon for somebody to be attracted to a healthy person
 But the healthy person doesn't keep the complaining people around very long right the healthy person's probably going to try and help them do something
 But after a while they're gonna be done with that that toxicity right you might be a victim if feeling bad for yourself gives you pleasure or
 relief
 How many times have you experienced that
 Feeling bad makes you feel good
 Feeling bad gives you relief
 Feeling bad helps you to not feel bad about some other situation right
 You might be a victim you might be a victim if you feel attacked when others offer you
 Helpful
 Underlined score highlight helpful insight if your tendency is when somebody's trying to help you not take you down
 Not be unhealthy you know in their critique, but somebody who's trying to be helpful give you some helpful insight
 Is to feel attacked you're probably a victim
 You might be a victim if you refuse to self-examine for fear of what's really there
 If you're afraid to dig deep and find out what's really there
 Might be a victim you might be a victim if you don't feel like you measure up to objective standards listen
 You may not
 But it doesn't mean that you're a victim many times people look at objective standards in life
 And they see that maybe they aren't measuring up
 Right or maybe they absolutely do but they don't feel like they are and so instead of just
 Being objective about where they are you know setting a correct reality about where they are they become a victim
 You might be a victim if your knee jerk reaction is to get defensive and self-protect oh goodness gracious
 Listen this should actually be be my number one
 When you find that your knee jerk reaction is defensiveness
 Especially self-protection
 When you find that your knee jerk reaction is self-protection or defensiveness you have got victim mentality
 Right anybody who has a modicum of healthiness to themselves
 Well actually stop for a second before having a knee jerk reaction and start gaining quality perspective
 Is this thing that's happening happening to me do I have any options here? Do I have any control?
 Is this thing this person just said about me is any of it true?
 You know maybe they said it in a really mean way, but are they are they right?
 You know a healthy person will self-examine very quickly an unhealthy person and
 To certain extent a very toxic person will knee jerk into
 Defensiveness and especially self protection you might be a victim if you see yourself as lacking
 You see yourself as empty you see yourself as insufficient or you see yourself as as
 Unable or or you see yourself as all of those things
 Right if you find that you're constantly
 Self-assessing
 That you're lacking that you're empty that you're insufficient well then you're probably got victim mentality and your self-awareness meter is not
 Working well right your self assessment is not working very well
 Right if you're always experiencing that how are you living how are you making it how are you still breathing
 Right if you can't be sufficient for anything if you're always unable right if you're always lacking
 So most likely you're experiencing victim mentality you might be a victim if you don't feel like you have any choices or any control in your life
 This is always a
 immediate clue to victim mentality
 Whenever somebody is like there was absolutely nothing I could do
 And the thing that they're talking about that they're pointing to you can immediately point out five different things that they could have done differently
 Well that's victim mentality and finally
 You might be a victim if your knee jerk reaction is to shift blame and
 Responsibility to others so listen
 If you are suffering needlessly in any of these ways then it's time for you to get out of that rut
 There are things that you can do
 So I'm gonna give you
 Five things that you can do right now to start working your way out of that rut number one is
 Get healthy people healthy people who love and respect you to speak into your life now
 If you are a colossal victim there may not be a whole lot of healthy people around you right now
 You may know some healthy people but they may be keeping you at a distance right now
 So it's probably going to blow their mind if you go to them and say I need you to speak into my life
 And I promise I'm gonna do everything I can
 That's a self-protect the be defensive and attack you back
 right the thing is it's a funny thing
 If people want my help I am so here to help
 The interesting thing is is only the people who are willing to get help come and seek our help
 Right only the people who are willing to say
 Maybe I am the problem
 Maybe I do have some things I need to change about myself and that's okay
 Here's a deal
 Never ever ever ever ever ever ever do we treat people in a way of just going well?
 You're just stupid. This is ridiculous. You're the problem
 That doesn't help anybody
 Instead we help them to see what what's going on the what the surface level responses the lies
 The decisions in life the choices these things and then we help them to see why those things exist
 We blow past the what so we can get to the why so that people can go oh my gosh now I see it
 I've never seen it like that before
 Now I can see it and now I can make different decisions one of the things we tell people all the time and next level
 Life is we will help you to see this information you can choose to stay the same
 The problem is once you see the information that's the last thing you want
 Nobody wants to stay that the way that you know if they're making and this is the assumption
 That they're making bad decisions in life or other in a bad place we have tons of people that come through that have
 Never had any bad problems aren't making terrible decisions all that kind of stuff
 It's there's a spectrum from people with no issues in life and great childhoods and great careers and great
 Families and they just want better lives to people that have been through the worst crap you could possibly experience
 So it's not just one aspect, right?
 But when they come in what do they experience healthy people who
 Want to love on them who want to teach them and grow them and speak into their lives
 You've got to get healthy people around you who love and respect you
 So that they can speak into your life number two get yourself into a faith community
 Where they teach you to love God
 I can tell you I'm somebody who grew up
 Not having any problem with the justice side of God
 The way I was I was raised in the things I've experienced in life
 Understanding the justice side of God was never a problem if I screwed up
 I was able to understand very quickly that I consequences were coming my way
 Right that is not an issue for me
 Understanding the nurturing side of God that's a different story that has been taking me a lifetime to come to
 Understand and learn and grow in and praise God how a loyette's happening, right?
 You need to have people who help you
 Possibly teach you how you need to love God
 And one of the biggest ways you can learn to love God is to discover how the king of the universe
 loves you
 is to discover how the king of the universe
 Applies worth to you
 The king of the universe who knows that you are living in this life that you're a part of this life that this is
 Not easy to get through that there's a lot of issues and a lot of struggles a lot of pain a lot of evil
 But he still pursues your heart every single day
 When you can see how he sees you and what your worth to him is
 The last thing you will seek is worth from other people especially through victim mentality
 Number three get your butt into next-level life
 So that we can root out these lies
 It is one of the most powerful pieces when people are able to recognize that the negative self-talk is
 Fixable that there's something that we have tools for them to overcome that
 That is so crazy powerful when people first off recognize the lies. I mean we've had people go what do you mean the lies I tell myself
 And then 15 minutes later they've got a list of 20 or 30 things that they're just like oh my gosh
 I tell myself the stuff all the time and then we give them tools of how to overcome those things get your butt into next-level life
 Number four get yourself into counseling if you are experiencing any depression or grief
 Listen everybody should have somebody to talk through especially if you're experiencing depression or grief
 Some of you don't even know that you're grieving
 Some of you aren't aware that you're depressed
 So it's good to be able to get with somebody and actually walk through
 How to overcome that or even experience a lot of folks get stuck in grief and they don't walk through all the stages of grief
 Because they don't realize that they're in it
 Some people believe it or not
 Have been trained that they're not allowed to experience those things and that you know that's that's
 Bunk or they shouldn't be experiencing those things and so they're not able to walk through it get through it griefs a real thing
 Sorry
 grief is a real thing
 The great thing is praise God there's a process of getting through the grief
 You just gotta walk through it number five get your personal growth plan out dust it off and get to work
 Do it now
 Where's your personal growth plan if you haven't gone back and listen to that episode go back and listen to it
 Sit yourself down and create what am I going to do to grow?
 Personally what am I gonna do in my life? What am I gonna change? What am I gonna accelerate? What am I gonna?
 De-seller it what am I gonna edit out what am I gonna add to it? What does it look like to have healthy people
 Surrounding me or me trying to go get around healthy people what does that look like right what is my plan for my marriage for my career for my finances
 My spirituality my relationship with God
 If you don't have that plan
 You gotta get what you gotta sit down and put one together if you do get it out dust that浜
 It's probably a little if you're experiencing victim and tell it. He's probably a little dusty right now
 So get that thing going and get to work right now
 Well folks hopefully this has helped you today. I know this is a tough subject
 Especially for those who may have been listening to this and going oh my gosh. I think that's actually me
 I can tell you of the people that sit in a chair in next level of life or
 Experience something in strap plan or anytime you know any of the processes that we do
 Of the people who come to find out that they have victim mentality which is a good 60% or more probably
 Almost every time it's a surprise
 There are times it's not but those are the few and far between and we always appreciate that self-examination
 But almost always it's a surprise
 I never thought that I had victim mentality
 I always thought I knew who did and I never thought it was me and then a good portion of the time
 People are upset and they're ready to get over it. I'm done. I don't want that. I'm alive anymore. So
 Hopefully this has helped you today
 Keep digging keep seeking get your butt next level life
 Focus heavily on your worth of God that's gonna be a big piece as well. Let's get you some some gloves some personal growth
 As always take this information change your leadership change your business change your life and join us on the next episode
