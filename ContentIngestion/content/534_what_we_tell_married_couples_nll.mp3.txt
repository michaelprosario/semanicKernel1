 From years of next-level life events, couples events, and counseling, the top three things that we tell married couples.
 That is coming up next.
 Welcome to the Crystal Cardo Show, where we discuss leadership and life,
 and discover that business is what you do, not who you are.
 Welcome to the show, folks. I hope you're having a fabulous day wherever you are.
 We're going to have some fun today and talk about the top advice in council that we find ourselves giving to married couples.
 Now, after more than 10 years, it's crazy to think, well over 500 events now, over 10 years of events,
 we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got a lot of events, and we've got
 that are the top common things that we talk about.
 I'm going to give it to you, believe it or not, I'm going to give it to you in an order that's actually backwards,
 but will probably make the most sense to you in the order that I give it.
 Because sometimes we hear things in the most important thing, which is the most obvious is the thing that we don't really pay attention to,
 because we think we already understand it.
 So instead, I'm going to reverse the order and give them to you in a way that I think is going to probably set everything up to make the most sense.
 So the big key is we all have to understand that relationships no matter what they are, they're tough, right?
 Relationships can be tough. You can have the greatest person on the planet as your spouse or a friend or a parent,
 and relationships still have a level of difficulty, and sometimes it can be messy, and sometimes it can be really messy.
 So what do we find ourselves talking about when we sit down with couples that are doing great or couples that are wanting to do better or couples that are struggling?
 Well, let's find out.
 The first thing that we talk about, and again, I'm reversing this order, but I think it's going to make sense.
 The first thing that we help couples to know is that you don't really know her or him the way you think you do.
 You know that person a lot.
 I know my wife immensely.
 I feel like I know her better than she knows herself.
 And of course, I do this for a living.
 So there's aspects of that that I believe I actually do know her better than I know herself, and yet,
 my wife continues to surprise me.
 And there's things I continue to learn about her.
 You've got to keep learning.
 You've got to keep learning about your spouse.
 There are things that you're probably not aware of.
 There are desires that you're probably not aware of.
 There are things that your spouse sees in ways that you most likely do not.
 And without spending time learning that gaining quality perspective about your spouse,
 it keeps you in a place where you assume that you know your spouse.
 It keeps you in a place where you believe that you understand what your spouse's love language is,
 what that you understand their personality style really well, that you understand their habits.
 But folks, just as you change over time,
 you're not aware of your spouse.
 So does your spouse.
 And just as you may not want to admit it, hold things back from your spouse,
 and you probably don't want to hear this.
 So does your spouse.
 Plus, on top of all of that, there are aspects that you or your spouse don't truly understand about yourself.
 So you don't even know how to communicate it well.
 So trying to help your spouse to understand these things about you sometimes comes out a little messy,
 a little crazy.
 So here's what I'm saying.
 It is great how much you know your spouse plan on learning about your spouse for the rest of your marriage,
 the rest of your life.
 Right?
 The more you do, the better your relationship.
 There are probably aspects of things and what are some of the big issues,
 communication we obviously know communication is is a big struggle inside of a relationship.
 Even if you have a great relationship, there are things we don't communicate well.
 There are aspects of how we want the other spouse to be able to read our mind.
 Well, you should understand what I'm thinking.
 You should know what I'm thinking.
 You've been with me for many years.
 You should know these things.
 And that's obviously impossible.
 No matter how good you are at it,
 how good are you at it, how good are you at it,
 assuming what your spouse is going through.
 One of the biggest issues is that we don't know what they're thinking at that time.
 And again, funny as it is doing what I do for a living and helping people to understand themselves
 and understand processes in their minds,
 I still can't tell you what you're thinking.
 A lot of times I can assume it a lot of times I can be spot on.
 And then there's plenty of times I have no clue.
 You can't possibly know what your spouse is thinking all the time.
 You may be able to get pretty good at it.
 You may be able to recognize certain aspects.
 But instead of just assuming gain quality perspective,
 ask some questions.
 Do you again learn?
 Grow?
 Find out what they're thinking?
 Find out what they're processing?
 One of the things that my wife started saying to me years ago is she said,
 "Process out loud."
 Because I have a tendency to process things pretty deeply.
 I go through a lot of information.
 That's how I do what I do.
 I need to see it from many angles.
 I want to think about what does this mean?
 How could it fail?
 As much as I possibly can?
 One of the things I was not doing was helping her to know what my thoughts were.
 When I'm going through a deep processing situation,
 so what do I remember just sitting there?
 I'm processing something and she goes, "Process out loud."
 I just bust it out laughing.
 I was like, "Yeah, but that would probably help you if I did that."
 I do.
 I'm going to say this while I'm processing it.
 Why do we not normally do that?
 We don't normally do that because for some people,
 the fear of sounding stupid is a big fear.
 My gosh, if you can't sound stupid in front of your spouse,
 what kind of relationship do you have?
 I say all kinds of stupid things.

 We're probably going to start creating some content in the future, talking about that.
 What that looks like.
 But I serve my wife.
 My wife serves me.
 We serve our family.
 Our family understands how to serve.
 These are things that are vitally important so that we don't become selfish and self-centered human beings.
 We understand it's okay to take time.
 Plenty of times we need time.
 There's quite often.
 My wife is pushing hard on something and I'm like, hey, baby, why don't you just take some time?
 Just chill.
 There's no hurry here.
 We don't need to finish something in two seconds.
 Why don't you just take some time and chill?
 And the funny thing is she'll sit there for a second and go, nope, I'm good.
 Solve it.
 You know, many times I will be dealing with something stressful and it's just like, I just need 30 seconds to get out of my brain.
 You know, I need to just get, let me solve this and move on.
 But there's times where men we enjoy just getting away and spending time together just the two of us.
 Or there's times that we enjoy, you know, we don't do this nearly as often enough,
 but just going and get them a massage or something or, you know, my wife goes and treats herself to, you know, manicures and pedicures and stuff like that,
 which is she really enjoys that time.
 Nothing wrong with that.
 We like taking a walk together just at the end of the day, grab a glass of wine.
 Let's go walk the farm and enjoy it.
 Take it in.
 Soak in its beauty.
 You know, just spend time together, no work, no phones, no talk about work, no discussing stressful stuff,
 just walking around and talking about what's beautiful, right?
 So there is self care that is good.
 It is quality.
 But if you're following the message that tells you you're the most important thing on the planet and you should take care of yourself that way.
 That I'm telling you, it's only going to lead to disaster.
 It's going to lead to victim mentality with you.
 It's going to lead to bad relationships in your life.
 All right, the third important thing, which again, for me, this would be the number one thing after you've learned more about your spouse after you've learned.
 Your selfish, and you need to work on that.
 Then this number one thing, which is number three, I'm confusing myself right now.
 This is really the most important thing.
 And if you just focus on it by itself and you don't do it in relationship, then you're going to discover your missing aton.
 What is it?
 Grow together in God.
 Grow together in God first and serve each other well second.
 So a couple that pursues God, which is definitely someone higher and more important in yourself, right?
 Well, ultimately grow together not further apart.
 We see it all the time.
 When we help couples to grow in their relationship with God, to understand God more, to understand how to study God, to understand their worth in God,
 it is amazing how much stronger the couple becomes.
 The couple who learns to put God first will eventually serve and love each other better and better as the years go by.
 Why?
 Because God's love becomes part of their relationship.
 Now, let me tell you what I see when it comes to love, scripturally.
 If you ask the average person, what is love in the Bible?
 It's caring for people.
 It's an emotional state of being.
 But when you read love through the scriptures, what you tend to find is that love is selfless sacrifice.
 Love is sacrificing you for somebody else selflessly.
 God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.
 When you are caring for others, when you take a look at the apostles, when you take a look at Yeshua,
 when you take a look at how people loved, scripturally, it tends to involve sacrifice.
 When you learn God's love and how much he has sacrificed for you and how long suffering he has for you,
 and how he continues to pursue your heart, then you begin to gain more sacrifice you love toward God.
 The more sacrifice you love you have for God, the easier and the more sacrifice you love you will have for your spouse.
 The more you can take care of your spouse and serve your spouse and love your spouse.
 The more your spouse will learn to also do the same for you.
 So if as a couple we are focusing on God first, together, learning to grow a relationship with him together,
 then what we start to do is learn how to serve each other incredibly well.
 And folks, if you have never had a marriage where you and your spouse are serving each other, then you are absolutely missing out.
 How do you get there? Well, my spouse doesn't want to serve me. My spouse is selfish and stubborn.
 I'm sure you are not at all.
 How do you get it going? Start focusing on your relationship with God.
 Well, my spouse doesn't want to spend time with me on gaining your relationship with God.
 Fine. Start with you.
 Focus with you.
 Help to get rid of a lot of the bitterness, the anger, the struggles.
 Yeah, you may be valid.
 They may be legit, but what I'm telling you is the more you focus on growing together in God.
 And even if it has to start with you individually, God will do the rest.
 God promises that if you're obedient to him and you focus on him, then he will bless you and he will bless your descendants.
 So spend time growing together with God and then learn how to serve each other well.
 So listen, couples, you can't afford to ignore these important instructions.
 You've got to make progress here. You've got to work on these things every day of your life.
 I know it sounds daunting. Trust me. It will become easier.
 It will become something that you desire to do. If you need help, we are here for you.
 Go to Chrissacrid.com and take a look at the what we do section.
 So whether it's next level of life or a couple's next level of life, do whatever it takes to get the information and the help that you need.
 We know relationships are tough. Pline and simple. We're in them.
 We struggle in ourselves. We just follow the stuff that we teach and we help people with it.
 No doubt about it. It's tough. It can be heck of a lot easier.
 Sometimes you need the help to get on stock or out of a rut, but make sure that you're pressing into these three things.
 Keep learning about each other.
 Kill the selfishness in your own heart. Grow together in God and serve each other well.
 Maybe you need to learn each other's personality styles first.
 Even if you've been married forever, don't take it for granted that you know what's always going on in their heads.
 It's just it's impossible. Be curious. Ask questions.
 Game perspective. Seek to understand.
 And most importantly, keep learning. So if you've not done personality styles or you not done a long time, go to the online store and start learning about that stuff today.
 Go to christlacurto.com and click store and start learning the disk and values for you and your spouse.
 Or if you're dating, it doesn't matter or your kids.
